You’ve come this far! Once you’re ready to apply for acceptance to UMW’s Master of Business Administration program, this checklist will help you make sure you have everything you need:
<ul>
	<li>Application for Admission and a $50 application fee or fee waiver. Apply online, and we’ll waive the fee.</li>
	<li>An official transcript from every college or university you’ve attended, even if the courses were transferred to another institution.</li>
	<li>A current résumé, preferably with at least two years of professional or technical work experience.</li>
	<li>Official scores from a GMAT or GRE taken within the last five years. Use UMW test code 5398. (Students who already have a terminal degree conferred on a transcript can seek to have GMAT/GRE requirements waived.)</li>
	<li>A completed MBA Prerequisite Waiver Form.</li>
	<li><strong>International students</strong> should also submit their Request for Form I-20 (for F-1 visa candidates), International Transcript Evaluation, and demonstration of English Language Proficiency.</li>
</ul>
