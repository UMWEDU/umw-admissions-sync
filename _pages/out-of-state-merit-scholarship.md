An additional $4,000 award will be applied to all non-Virginia residents (including international students) while they reside on campus.

UMW is a residential college offering students from the surrounding local community the opportunity to live at home and attend class. Should an out-of-state student wish to live off campus, the comparable instate commuter scholarship may be substituted.
