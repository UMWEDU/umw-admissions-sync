We can’t wait to see your fresh face at UMW, hear your bright ideas in our classrooms, and get your unique perspectives in our labs. We might even be more excited than you are, but embarking on an international education takes planning. Before jumping in, get familiar with the main components of the international first-year applicant process.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Materials</strong>: You’re going to need a lot of “stuff.” A completed <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common Application</a>, an essay, and your $50 USD application fee or approved waiver are just for starters. See the <a href="/admissions/international/international-checklist/">International Admissions Checklist</a> for a complete list of required documents. Keep in mind the suggested application filing dates of <strong>Jan.</strong><strong> 1</strong> for priority applications and <strong>Feb. 1</strong> for regular decision.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>English translation</strong>: All official academic records and transcripts (from every secondary school, college, university, and technical/vocational/professional institute you’ve attended) must be sent to UMW in English or accompanied by a complete, literal English translation certified by the issuing institution. Documents must also include the issuing institution’s original stamp or seal, and an official signature, and cannot be returned or transferred. Translations are available at <a href="http://www.wes.org/">World Education Services Inc.</a>, <a href="https://www.ece.org/">Educational Credential Evaluators</a>, and the <a href="http://www.aacrao.org/">American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>English proficiency</strong>: Students whose first language is English, whose native country names English an official language, who are graduating from a secondary school in a native English-speaking country or from an International Baccalaureate secondary school, or who scored well on the SAT verbal portion may request a waiver of the English language requirement. Otherwise, sufficient results are required from one of the following:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">Test of English as a Foreign Language</a> (TOEFL). Applicants must earn a composite score of 88 TOEFL IBT.</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.ielts.org/">International English Language Testing System</a> (IELTS). Applicants must earn a score of 6.5 on the academic exam.</li>
 	<li><a href="https://sat.collegeboard.org/home">College Board’s SAT</a>. Applicants must earn a critical reading score of 550 to 640 and a math score of 550 to 620. (Use UMW SAT testing code 5398.)</li>
 	<li>Applicants must earn a composite score of 23 or higher. (Use UMW ACT testing code 4414.)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.els.edu/en/EnglishPrograms/Program?prgm=EAP-GeneralEnglish-academic-english">Certificate of Completion</a> from the ELS Language Center’s Intensive English Program, including Level 112, English for Academic Purposes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<em>Students who meet academic requirements but whose IELTS, TOEFL, SAT, or ACT scores are insufficient may be offered a conditional Letter of Admission and required to attend ELS Language Centers, which partners with UMW.</em>
