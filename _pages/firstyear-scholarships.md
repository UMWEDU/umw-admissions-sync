To be considered for merit based scholarships, first year students must meet the February 1 Regular Admission application filing date. Admitted students who meet the filing date will automatically be considered for merit scholarships based on cumulative GPA and standardized test scores (SAT or ACT), information that is already part of a complete application for admission. Merit scholarship awards will be included with the offer of admission to the University.
