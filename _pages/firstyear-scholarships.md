Apply for admission and  you <b>automatically become eligible to be considered</b> for select scholarships. <span id="OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION">To be considered for merit and curriculum based scholarships, first year students must meet the February 1 admissions filing date.</span> Shortly after your admission, we’ll notify you of your scholarship eligibility. Scholarships for first-year students applying for fall are based off the below criteria regarding GPA and SAT or ACT scores.  Check out our <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/undergraduate/checklist/freshman-scholarships/washington-and-alvey/">Washington and Alvey Scholarships</a> for information on our <a href="/admissions/freshman-scholarships/washington-and-alvey/">full-ride</a> opportunities, and the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/undergraduate/checklist/test-optional/">test optional</a> page for information on scholarships for incoming students <strong>not submitting test scores</strong>.
