Designed as a completion program for registered nurses who hold an associate’s degree, UMW’s Bachelor of Nursing Degree Completion Program prepares graduates to identify and improve patient care within a complex healthcare system, to assume more vital roles within the medical profession, and to continue their nursing education to the graduate level. Online hybrid classes make it easy to enroll full time to complete the program in just one year, or study on a part-time basis.

The <a href="http://umwwebmaster.wpengine.com/admissions/adult/bsn/bsn-curriculum/">curriculum</a> combines UMW’s tradition of liberal arts with American Association of Colleges of Nursing, <em>Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice</em>, recommendations. Students take three liberal arts courses and seven higher level nursing courses, and receive valuable mentorships from UMW faculty and nursing leaders in the Fredericksburg community.

If you’re a registered nurse who wants more from your career in healthcare, UMW’s Bachelor of Science in Nursing Degree Completion Program can take you there. Check out the following FAQs, and be sure to let us know if you have more questions.
<h2>Is UMW’s Bachelor of Nursing program right for me?</h2>
The program is designed for graduates of associate degree or hospital diploma programs who hold an RN license in Virginia and who wish to gain a bachelor of science in nursing. Applicants must have attained a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 on a 4.0 scale in undergraduate study. Applicants who earned a GPA lower than 3.0 may be considered with additional documentation. See the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Admissions Checklist for specifics. Link to 6.3.2 BSN Admissions Checklist
<h3>Will I get to take advantage of academic credit I’ve already earned?</h3>
Students receive 41 credits for having gained licensure as a registered nurse through a community college or accredited hospital diploma program. Students may transfer as many as 90 credits, including general education and prerequisite course credits from another school. However, to complete the BSN Completion Program, students must earn 30 at UMW. See the BSN Degree Completion Curriculum (link to 6.3.2.1 BSN Curriculum) page for course details.
<h3>How long will it take me to earn my degree?</h3>
Enroll full time and finish the program in just one year, or take classes part time and earn your degree at your own pace.
<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
The BSN Completion Program teaches registered nurses concepts related to clinical reasoning, critical thinking, cultural sensitivity, evidence-based practice, genetics and genomics, informatics, inter-professional teams, life-long learning, patient-centered care, patient safety, professionalism, quality improvement, and practice across the lifespan. See the BSN Degree Completion Curriculum (link to 6.3.2.1 BSN Curriculum) page for course details.
<h3>How will earning a BSN enhance my career?</h3>
Upon completion of the BSN degree, nurses will be able to practice as members of the profession and be in a position to assume the roles of provider, designer, manager, and coordinator of care in a healthcare system of growing complexity.
<h3>Where and how are the classes offered?</h3>
The BSN Degree Completion Program is located on the Stafford campus of the University of Mary Washington, on U.S. 17 North, near Interstate 95. Classes will be offered in an online/distance-learning hybrid format in eight-week blocks.
<h3>How and when do I apply to the program?</h3>
Suggested filing dates to apply to UMW’s BSN program are <strong>April 1 </strong>for fall, <strong>Oct. 15</strong> for spring, and <strong>March 1</strong> for summer. See the BSN Admissions Checklist (link to 6.3.2 BSN Admissions Checklist) for a list of required materials. Apply online using the Application for Undergraduate Degree Completion Programs(Link to this, https://www.applyweb.com/umw/).
<h3>How will I learn if I’ve been accepted to the program?</h3>
Look for a letter from the Office of Admissions. Once accepted, students are contacted by the director of the BSN Completion Program for advisement and registration.
<h3>Can I earn a BSN from UMW, even if I am not already a registered nurse?</h3>
Yes. UMW and Germanna Community College (GCC), recognized the need for registered nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees in nursing through an improved education system promoting seamless academic progression. Together, we created a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Academic Partnership Plan (BSN-APP), also known as a 1 + 2 + 1 BSN Plan. The agreement is designed for UMW pre-BSN students interested in earning a pre-licensure associate of applied science (A.A.S.) degree in nursing from GCC and a post-licensure bachelor of science in nursing from UMW. Check it out! (Link to 6.3.2.1.1_BSN-APP)
