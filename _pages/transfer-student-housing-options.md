<h2>We’ll Leave the Lights on for You!</h2>

No matter where you’ve studied before, we want you to feel at home at the University of Mary Washington. Academics and extracurricular activities will frame your time here, but picking a place to live that suits your personality, makes you feel comfortable, and puts a spring in your step is key to a great college experience.

So, to live on or off campus – that is now the question...

<h2>On-campus housing</h2>

Convenience, proximity to classes and classmates, security, and wringing the most out of the traditional college experience, living right in the thick of things, are all pluses that lure students to on-campus quarters. Restricted access to residential buildings, nearby UMW Police, and Resident Assistants on duty each night add to a feeling of safety. Residence Life staff promote community learning and help see students through challenges. And, with fellow students just down the hall or right across campus, there’s plenty of opportunity for out-of-class learning.

UMW offers an array of on-campus housing options, from residence halls to student apartments. Check out the choices at <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/">Residence Life</a>.

<h2>Off-campus housing</h2>

Need your own space and some distance from campus? Location, cost, lease agreements, roommates, and the usual rigmarole that’s packed in with moving – even pesky details like trash pick-up and lawn care options – are just some of the things you’ll need to consider when choosing off-campus housing at UMW.
