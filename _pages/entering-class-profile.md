This profile is intended to provide a general picture of the students who were admitted and enrolled by UMW in the Bachelor of Arts/Bachelor of Science degree program for the fall of 2020. Any statistical portrait is limited in its ability to describe the full range of individual differences among students who are enrolled by the University. UMW does not admit students by any rigid formula, and we seek to enroll a diverse and well-rounded student body.
<h2>COVID-19 Impact</h2>
Additionally, this will be the first entering class impacted by COVID-19. Uncertainty regarding the virus necessitated planning for multiple modalities including virtual, face to face, and hybrid teaching.  Student enrollment decisions were also affected economically and by personal comfort with regard to residential campus experiences and learning preferences (face to face v. virtual experiences).
<h2>The Freshman Class</h2>
The Admissions Committee reviews each candidate’s file individually, giving careful consideration to all aspects of the record. The committee places strong emphasis on the quality of the student’s secondary school curriculum. Successful candidates present records of sound preparation for study in the liberal arts and sciences. Advanced, honors-level, and Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate course work is highly encouraged.

The committee reviewed 6,019 freshman applications for the fall of 2020. Admission was offered to 4,544 candidates and 777 students enrolled as first-time students.
<h2>Multicultural Diversity</h2>
The University of Mary Washington strives to enroll a student body that is culturally and ethnically diverse. In 2020, nearly 30% percent of the entering students identified themselves as racially or ethnically diverse.
<h2>Secondary School Performance</h2>
The University of Mary Washington views each freshman candidate’s academic achievement is viewed in the context of his or her particular high school. When evaluating high-school performance, we give consideration to the course offerings and academic character of each secondary school. Applicants who are admitted to UMW have excelled in strong programs of study, typically including Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or similar honors-level and advanced classes. Although there is much variation among high schools, grade-point average is one important descriptor of the academic quality of the freshman class.

In the information below, the “Middle 50%” indicates the range into which fell the middle one-half of the GPA, SAT, and ACT scores. Therefore, 25% were above this range while 25% were below the range.

<strong>Please note that UMW is test choice and applicants are not required to provide standardized test scores for admission consideration.</strong>  Additionally, UMW automatically considers students admitted under the test choice policy for renewable Curriculum Scholarships.
