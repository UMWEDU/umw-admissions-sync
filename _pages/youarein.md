Welcome to the University of Mary Washington! We're excited to have you join us as we saw something very special in you. We truly believe that UMW is an ideal match for your talents and interests.

<a href="/admissions/youarein/enrollment-deposit/">Pay your deposit</a>. To pay online, you'll need your Student ID which can be found on your enrollment form in your offer packet. We do encourage students to deposit online. If students mail in documents and deposits, the processing will be delayed as the University is working remotely. The fastest way is to deposit online and there is no fee for e-checks.

Check out the next steps for becoming a full member of the UMW family! These differ for transfers and first year students entering in <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/youarein/next-steps/transfers">spring</a> and <a href="/admissions/youarein/next-steps/">fall</a>. We look forward to seeing you on campus! If you’re an incoming first year student, be sure to join the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/UMWClassof2024official">UMW Class of 2024</a> Facebook page!
