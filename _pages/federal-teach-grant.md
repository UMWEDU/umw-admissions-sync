Through the College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007, Congress created the Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher Education (TEACH) Grant Program that provides grants of up to $4,000 per year to students who are completing or plan to complete course work needed to begin a career in teaching.

As a condition for receiving a TEACH Grant:

You must complete the <a href="https://studentloans.gov/myDirectLoan/launchTeach.action">TEACH Grant counseling</a> that explains the terms and conditions of the TEACH Grant service obligation. You must complete counseling each year that you receive a TEACH Grant.

You must also sign a TEACH Grant Agreement to Serve in which you agree to (among other requirements) teach
<ul>
 	<li>in a high-need field;</li>
 	<li>at an elementary school, secondary school, or educational service agency that serves students from low-income families; and</li>
 	<li>for at least four complete academic years within eight years after completing (or ceasing enrollment in) the course of study for which you received the grant.</li>
</ul>
