The University of Mary Washington is proud to partner with <a href="https://www.ila.edu/">International Language Academy</a> of Washington, D.C. (ILA) to provide English as a second language education for prospective UMW students. If you do not meet the UMW English language requirement (80 on TOEFL or  6.5 on IELTS), you may consider enrolling at ILA. Eligible students who complete their English studies at ILA are guaranteed acceptance into the University of Mary Washington upon successful completion of levels 11 and 12 of the Intensive English Program. Sessions begin every four weeks on ILA’s campus in McLean, VA.

With the <strong><em>ILA to Mary Washington Bridge Program</em></strong>, students may not only gain English language skills, but also begin UMW college courses, helping in the cultural transition to completing a degree at the university. ILA will provide instruction on Mary Washington’s campus beginning in January 2018.

Once a student completes level 10 at ILA, he or she has the opportunity to take college classes on UMW’s campus while completing levels 11 &amp; 12 of the Intensive English Program. The bridge program facilitates the enrollment process by preparing international students to speak, read, and write English at a high academic level, and acts as a transitional program beyond the scope of English language learning. By enrolling concurrently in UMW courses, ILA students will have time to adjust to cultural differences by living on the Fredericksburg campus and participating in co-curricular activities, academic support services, and more.

Prospective students may apply to ILA and indicate which option they are interested in pursuing: non-bridge or bridge enrollment.
