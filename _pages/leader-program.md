The Presidential Emerging Leaders Program is a new one year leadership development program designed to help first year students create lasting friendships, make meaningful connections across campus, and develop their leadership profile. Selected students will participate in activities that include personal leadership development, team building, skill-building sessions, and networking with campus influencers including University President Troy Paino.

Participants will spend the year immersed in various experiential learning opportunities where they will explore what kind of leader they aspire to be.Â  Participation in this program will serve as a solid springboard to future engagement opportunities on and off campus.

This program is open to all majors and requires no prior leadership experience or knowledge.
