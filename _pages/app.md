<h2>There’s more than one way to earn a BSN from UMW!</h2>
UMW and Germanna Community College (GCC), recognizing the need for registered nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees in nursing, created a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Academic Partnership Plan (BSN-APP). Also known as a 1 + 2 + 1 BSN Plan, the program provides an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression. The agreement is designed for UMW pre-BSN students interested in earning a pre-licensure associate of applied science (A.A.S.) degree in nursing from GCC and a post-licensure bachelor of science in nursing from UMW.
<h2>Years 1, (2 &amp; 3), 4 Explained</h2>
<h3>Year 1:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>During the freshman year, students will complete required liberal arts and nursing prerequisite courses at UMW. In addition, students will complete SDV 100, BIO 141, and BIO 142 at GCC.</li>
	<li>Financial aid awards will be planned using the costs of both programs, and the process is still in development.</li>
	<li>Students will apply for a second admission to the GCC Nursing Program by April 1st for the following fall term.  Students must meet all published procedures and deadlines for application to the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
	<li>Pre-licensure nursing programs are competitive. University of Mary Washington students entering the BSN-APP (1 + 2 + 1 BSN Plan) during their freshman year are not guaranteed acceptance to the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
	<li>University of Mary Washington students who live on campus will use their UMW address to qualify for GCC residency requirements.</li>
	<li>University of Mary Washington students who elect to live off campus must claim residency in one of the following areas: Culpeper, Madison, Orange, Spotsylvania, Stafford, Fredericksburg, Caroline, or King George.</li>
	<li>Students must provide their own transportation to GCC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Years 2 &amp; 3:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students who are admitted to the GCC Nursing Program will attend GCC’s Nursing Program and earn an A.A.S. degree in nursing.</li>
	<li>Financial aid awards will be planned using the costs of both programs, and the process is still in development.</li>
	<li>Students may take the three non-NURS courses of the UMW BSN Completion Program during these two years.</li>
	<li>Students will be able to continue their UMW student life (e.g. campus residence life and campus dining) while completing the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
	<li>Students must have their own transportation so that they may attend nursing classes, nursing labs, and clinical assignments.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Year 4:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Students will return to UMW to finish the BSN Completion Program during the fourth year. Upon return to UMW, students must submit a major declaration form to the Office of the Registrar to change the major to the BSN completion major.</li>
	<li>Students may begin taking UMW courses that begin with the NURS prefix after they present a current and valid unencumbered license to practice nursing (RN) in the Commonwealth of Virginia.</li>
	<li>Students have 5 years, following graduation with an A.A.S. degree in nursing, to complete the fourth year at UMW.</li>
</ul>
