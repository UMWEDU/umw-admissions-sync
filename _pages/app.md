<h2>There’s more than one way to earn a BSN from UMW!</h2>
UMW and Germanna Community College (GCC), recognizing the need for registered nurses to achieve baccalaureate degrees in nursing, created a Bachelor of Science in Nursing Academic Partnership Plan (BSN-APP). Also known as a 1 + 2 + 1 BSN Plan, the program provides an improved education system that promotes seamless academic progression. The agreement is designed for UMW pre-BSN students interested in earning a pre-licensure associate of applied science (A.A.S.) degree in nursing from GCC and a post-licensure bachelor of science in nursing from UMW.
<h2>Years 1, (2 &amp; 3), 4 Explained</h2>
<h3>Year 1:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>First year students will complete required liberal arts and nursing prerequisite courses at UMW. In addition, students will complete SDV 100, BIO 141, and BIO 142 at GCC.</li>
 	<li>Students will apply for a second admission to the GCC Nursing Program by April 1st for the following fall term.  Students must meet all published procedures and deadlines for application to the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
 	<li>Pre-licensure nursing programs are competitive. UMW students entering the BSN-APP (1 + 2 + 1 BSN Plan) during their first year are not guaranteed acceptance to the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
 	<li>Students who live on campus will use their UMW address to qualify for GCC residency requirements.</li>
 	<li>Students are required to live on-campus.</li>
 	<li>Students must provide their own transportation to GCC.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Years 2 &amp; 3:</h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Students who are admitted to the GCC Nursing Program will attend GCC’s Nursing Program and earn an A.A.S. degree in nursing.</li>
 	<li>Financial aid awards will be planned using the costs of both programs, and the process is still in development.</li>
 	<li>Students continue to take liberal arts courses including three required BSN courses at UMW.</li>
 	<li>Students continue to live on the UMW campus, participate in activities, and dine at UMW while completing the GCC Nursing Program.</li>
 	<li>Students must have their own transportation so that they may attend nursing classes, nursing labs, and clinical assignments.</li>
</ul>
