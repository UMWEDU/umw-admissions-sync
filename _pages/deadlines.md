Deadlines have a way of getting away from us, so mark your calendar now and get going on your journey to earning a graduate degree from the University of Mary Washington.

Recommended filing dates are designed to give newly admitted students the best opportunity to register for their top-choice courses. Once the recommended filing dates have passed, UMW continues to accept applications on a rolling space-available basis.

The following are suggested filing dates for UMW’s graduate programs.
<h2>Master of Education – Teacher Licensure, Certificates, Add-on Endorsements</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fall Admission: April 15</li>
	<li>Spring Admission: Sept. 15</li>
	<li>Summer Admission: Feb. 15</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master of Science in Geospatial Analysis</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fall Admission: June 1</li>
	<li>Spring Admission: Oct. 1</li>
</ul>
<h2>Master of Business Administration – Accounting, General Business, Marketing</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fall Admission: Aug. 1</li>
	<li>Spring Admission: Nov. 15</li>
	<li>Summer Admission: April 1</li>
</ul>
(UMW’s MBA program also accepts non-degree students and admits degree-seeking students for the <strong>second</strong> eight-week session of each semester, which begins in October in the fall and in March in the spring. It’s a great way to get a head start on courses.)

Anyone interested in a Graduate Assistant position must apply for fall admission by March 1.
