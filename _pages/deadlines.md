The UMW recommended filing dates are designed to give newly admitted students the best opportunity to register for their top-choice courses. Once the recommended filing dates have passed, UMW continues to accept applications on a rolling, space-available basis.

<strong>The following are suggested filing dates for UMW’s graduate programs.</strong>

*UMW’s MBA program also accepts non-degree students and admits degree-seeking students for the <strong>second</strong> eight-week session of each semester, which begins in October in the fall and in March in the spring. It’s a great way to get a head start on courses!
