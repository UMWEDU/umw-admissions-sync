For graduates of the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) or Richard Bland College:

The University of Mary Washington welcomes applicants from Virginia’s two-year colleges. In fall 2020, 60% of our enrolled transfer students joined us from 19 branches of the VCCS and Richard Bland College. Many took advantage of the <a href="/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/UMW_VCCS_GAA_2012.pdf">Guaranteed Admission Agreement</a> (pdf) to streamline the admission process.

Students who graduate with an associate’s degree in arts, sciences, or arts and sciences with a minimum cumulative grade-point average of a 3.0 may obtain guaranteed admission to the University of Mary Washington. Acceptance in some degree programs at UMW is competitive; thus guaranteed admission into UMW does not necessarily guarantee admission to these programs without further acceptance by the program or department offering the program. The agreement specifies that the majority of general education requirements will be satisfied with the following exceptions:
<ul>
 	<li>Competency in a second language</li>
 	<li>Speaking- and writing- intensive course requirements</li>
 	<li>Experiential learning requirement</li>
</ul>
If you wish to invoke the Guaranteed Admission Agreement and receive a $50 application fee waiver, please complete the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/documents/document/gaa-student-letter-of-intent/">GAA Student Intent Form</a> and submit it to your community college counselor.
