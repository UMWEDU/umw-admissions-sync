<strong>3+3 Accelerated Program to George Mason University’s Antonin</strong> <strong>Scalia Law School</strong>

The track, known as the 3+3 Accelerated Program, provides highly motivated UMW students the opportunity to earn both a bachelor’s degree from Mary Washington and a law degree from George Mason University in six, rather than seven, years of study.

Under the program, UMW students must maintain a minimum cumulative 3.25 grade point average and complete all core curriculum and required courses for their major within the first three years. They may apply for admission to Scalia Law School during their third year, after obtaining an acceptable score on the Law School Admission Test (LSAT).

UMW is the first higher education institution outside of GMU to develop such an expedited relationship with the law school. Currently, the accelerated dual degree program with Scalia Law School is available only to George Mason students. The arrangement with UMW is effective beginning in fall 2017 semester.

Students who are interested in pursuing the accelerated law degree program must be approved by their undergraduate advisor during their freshman or sophomore year. For more information, contact Dean Finkelstein at <a href="mailto:rfinkels@umw.edu">rfinkels@umw.edu</a> or 540/654-1052, or visit the GMU Antonin Scalia Law School <a href="https://www.law.gmu.edu/admissions/jd/3_3_program">3+3 Accelerated Program page</a>.

<strong>Early Selection to The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences</strong>

The George Washington University and the University of Mary Washington have agreed to implement an early selection program for individuals interested in a career of medicine. Students who are accepted into and fulfill the requirements of the early selection program will be provided provisional admission to the four-year M.D. program at The George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences. Select individuals are exempt from taking the MCAT, allowing these students time to pursue other academic, clinical, and volunteer opportunities, including undergraduate research and/or study abroad.

Students apply by March 1 of their second year in the UMW Honors Program.  The UMW Honors program director and the UMW pre-medical program advisor will screen the applications and present selected files to The George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences Committee on Admission, which will review applications. The GWSMHS Committee on Admissions will review applications and make decisions regarding offer of an interview. Final decisions will be made by July.

For more information regarding requirements and process, contact Honors Program Director, Dr. Kelli Slunt at <a href="mailto:kslunt@umw.edu">kslunt@umw.edu</a> or <a href="mailto:honorsprogram@umw.edu">honorsprogram@umw.edu</a> or visit the <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/honorsprogram/gwu-early-acceptance-program/">GW Early Selection page</a>.
