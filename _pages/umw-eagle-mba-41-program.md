A graduate assistant in UMW’s athletic department, Taylor Johnson, MBA ’16, works in sports information and facility management. He felt a master’s degree would give him an edge in reaching his career goals in athletic administration. Having studied business at UMW as an undergrad, Johnson, who was also a star Eagles basketball player, has enjoyed learning from some of the same professors who already had served as his mentors. “Earning a master’s degree will help me jump-start my career,” Johnson said. “The MBA program has helped me sharpen my skills to become a well-rounded business student. I really enjoy the structure of the classes, which revolve around discussion.”
