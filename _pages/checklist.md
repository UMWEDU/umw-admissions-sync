<strong>International Admission Checklist</strong>

These are the items required of international applicants for admission consideration.

<strong>1. The Application</strong>

Apply online through the <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">The Common Application </a> or the <a href="http://Mycoalition.com">Coalition Application</a> and your essay/personal statement, plus your $50 application fee or approved waiver.

Remember to apply by the suggested filing date:
First Year applicants - Jan. 1 for priority admission or Feb. 1 for regular admission
Transfer applicants - Oct. 15 for spring and April 1 for fall

UMW accepts applications after these deadlines on a space-available basis and considering visa processing timelines.

<strong>2. Transcripts and/or Exam Scores</strong>

Send transcripts and/or exam results – matriculation/secondary school certificates, mark sheets, diplomas – with a certified copy of the English translation, for high school work you have completed. If you are applying as a transfer student, a transcript from each college or university you attended is also required.  Original documents are preferred; copies must be certified and attested by the U.S. embassy or notary public. Agencies offering translations include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.wes.org">World Education Services Inc.</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ece.org/">Educational Credential Evaluators</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>3. References</strong>

Submit at least one letter of recommendation from a counselor or teacher, using the <a href="https://recsupport.commonapp.org/link/portal/33011/33014/ArticleFolder/42/School-Report">Common Application Secondary School Report</a>.

<strong>4. English Language Proficiency</strong>

Proof of English language proficiency should be sent directly to UMW from the evaluating organization. These exam scores will get you in the running:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ila.edu/">International Language Academy</a> (ILA) Intensive English Program (Level 12 completion)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">Test of English as a Foreign Language</a> (TOEFL 80 IBT)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.ielts.org/">International English Language Testing System</a> (6.5 on the academic exam)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://sat.collegeboard.org/home">College Board’s SAT</a> (Evidence Based Critical Reading, 500; Math 500 or higher; use UMW SAT testing code 5398)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.actstudent.org/">ACT</a> (composite score of 22 or higher; use UMW ACT testing code 4414)</li>
</ul>
If your first language is English, your native country names English an official language, you’re graduating from a secondary school in a native English-speaking country or from an International Baccalaureate secondary school, or you scored well on the SAT verbal portion, you may request an English language requirement waiver.

<strong>5. Financial Support</strong>

Students are required to demonstrate financial ability to pay for at least one year of academic and living expenses and pay your enrollment deposit before being issued an I-20 by UMW.  Financial documents must be in English showing available liquidable funds (readily converted into cash) and cannot be older than three months.  Examples of appropriate documents may include:
<ul>
 	<li>Bank letter specifying the account holder, date, monetary currency, and amount of funds available.  The letter cannot simply state the client has “sufficient funds.”  Letters must be on official bank stationary, stamped and signed by a bank official.</li>
 	<li>Bank statements must show name of account holder, total available balance, and be on official bank stationary.  An on-line screen-shot or print out is acceptable, as long as these elements are included.</li>
 	<li>Funds must be liquid (readily converted into cash)</li>
 	<li>If a U.S. citizen or U.S. permanent resident is providing all or partial support, an I-134 Affidavit of Support is required.  The I-134 can be found at <a href="https://www.uscis.gov/i-134">https://www.uscis.gov/i-134</a>. Submit the completed I-134 to the CIE office.</li>
</ul>
