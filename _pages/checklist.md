Once you’re ready to apply you’ll need all the ‘when’ and ‘what’ details. Take a look at this handy checklist and start getting everything submitted. We’re excited to read your application!

Suggested filing dates are Nov. 1 for Early Decision, Nov. 15 for Early Action, and Feb. 1 for Priority. Students applying under Early Action will be notified of their acceptance status by the end of January. Regular admissions decisions are sent by letter on or about April 1. All who receive offers of admission have a National Candidate Reply Date of May 1.

Prospective high school seniors now have the option to interview with our Admissions staff as part of the admissions process. Students may choose to interview in person or provide a Zeemee profile to be considered for a "top-up" scholarship that ranges from $1,000 to $7,000.
<h2>Freshman Admission Checklist</h2>
Use the checklist below to be sure you’ve got everything covered.
<ul>
 	<li>Send <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/Login">The Common Application</a>, with all accompanying materials, including your essay and the application fee (or approved waiver), to UMW.</li>
 	<li>If you are requesting review under the binding Early Decision, you must invite your counselor to sign the Early Decision Agreement before you can submit your application.  If you are not able to gather signatures electronically, you may print the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/05/Early_Decision_Agreement.pdf">Early Decision Agreement</a> found here and send to UMW. Remember, this form has to be signed by the student, parent or legal guardian, and your high school counselor and is required to complete your Early Decision application.</li>
 	<li>Ask your guidance counselor to complete and sign the Secondary School Report, included on the Common Application, and provide a copy of your official high school transcript. (Home-schooled applicants should provide documentation of their educational experiences, as well.)</li>
 	<li>If you completed college work during high school, request that an official college transcript be sent to UMW.</li>
 	<li>Submit at least one letter of recommendation from your guidance counselor, teacher, or school official. (Find forms on <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/Login">The Common Application site</a>.)</li>
 	<li>Request your standardized test results be sent directly to UMW (SAT CEEB 5398, ACT 4414). Notify Admissions if you’ve taken the SAT or ACT using something other than your full legal name.
<ul>
 	<li>Read about our <a href="/admissions/undergraduate/checklist/test-optional/">test optional policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li>Ask your high school to send your mid-year grades to UMW so that the Admissions Committee will have your most current information.</li>
 	<li>If you’re filing a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (<a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a>), please submit it by March 1, using the UMW code 003746.</li>
</ul>
We can’t wait to get your application! We’ll send you an email when we receive it and let you know if anything’s missing. Please know that it’s your responsibility to make sure your file is complete and to keep copies of all application materials.
