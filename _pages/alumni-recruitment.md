As an alum, you know from personal experience that UMW is a special place to spend four years living and learning.  Alumni are many of our best ambassadors in recruitment. We hope that you will see opportunity in every conversation to recruit new students to Mary Washington.

<span style="color: red"><strong>Refer an Eagle Campaign</strong></span>

Do you know a high school senior or transfer student that would thrive at Mary Washington?  Share an application fee waiver code to waive the $50 application fee on the Common Application for admission to encourage the student to apply.
<ol>
 	<li>Give the student the code <strong>UMW51</strong>. He or she will select this code from a drop down menu on the application within the UMW questions when prompted.</li>
 	<li>Let Admissions know with whom you have shared the code. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> indicating the student’s full name, email address if you have it, and your name.</li>
</ol>
<strong>Do you have other ideas for how alumni can recruit new students?</strong>

Let us know!  Email your ideas to <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> and Admissions will follow up.
