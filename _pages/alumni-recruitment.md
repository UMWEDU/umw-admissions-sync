As an alum, you know from personal experience that UMW is a special place to spend four years living and learning.  Alumni are many of our best ambassadors in recruitment. We hope that you will see opportunity in every conversation to recruit new students to UMW.

We want you to know of a few options where we could use your assistance in bringing in our next class.

<p><font color="red"><strong>Refer an Eagle Campaign</strong></font></p>


Do you know a high school senior or transfer student that would thrive at Mary Washington?  Share an application fee waiver code to waive the $50 application fee on the Common Application for admission to encourage the student to apply.
<ol>
 	<li>Give the student the code <strong>UMW51</strong>. He or she will select this code from a drop down menu on the application within the UMW questions when prompted.</li>
 	<li>Let Admissions know with whom you have shared the code. Send us an email at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> indicating the student’s full name, email address if you have it, and your name.</li>
</ol>
<p><font color="red"><strong>Hometown Hero Program</strong></font></p>

The Admissions team is committed to attending college fairs throughout Virginia as well as the East Coast. But we simply cannot be everywhere. And we don’t know of every fair. We are looking to grow our out of state presence and reach more students than we have been able to before. We need you.  Be a Hometown Hero for UMW!

<strong>Step 1:</strong> Identify the college fair that serves your hometown or region. Check with local high schools or the local school board to learn the date, time and location of the event. Websites are often very helpful. Ask for a registration form if possible.

<strong>Step 2:</strong> Check your calendar. Are you free to represent UMW at the fair? If you can commit to be present, proceed to step 3.

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Email Admissions at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu"><strong>admit@umw.edu</strong></a>. Include details of the fair (who it serves, where it will be, when or simply attach the registration form) confirming you would like to attend.

<strong>Step 4:</strong> Attend the fair, answer general questions, encourage and collect information cards to capture students interest.

<strong>Step 5:</strong> Send UMW the cards and complete a quick online fair evaluation based on your experience.

Admissions will:
1.      Register you for the event including paying a fee to attend if required.
2.     Confirm registration with you.
3.     Send you a training document and be available for follow up questions or concerns.
4.     Send you materials to execute the fair.
5.     Follow up with students for whom you collect information at the fair.

College fairs occur mostly in September and October and again in March and April for juniors.  Let us know if you would like to be a Hometown Hero and share Mary Washington in your backyard!
