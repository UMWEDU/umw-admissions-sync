<h2>Fees and Billing</h2>
The charges for the 2019-20 academic year are $25,193 for a Virginia resident and $41,619 for a non-Virginia resident. Included in these charges are tuition, room, board, and most fees. Bills for the first semester are emailed to students’ UMW email accounts after registration. After that, bills for the spring semester are emailed in November, and bills for the fall semester are emailed in July. Semester bills include tuition, fees, room, and board, with a credit applied for scholarships, loans, or other financial awards. Any questions concerning the payment of fees should be directed to the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/studentaccounts">Office of Student Accounts</a>.
<h2>Financial Aid</h2>
The University of Mary Washington provides scholarships, grants, loans, and part-time campus employment to students who qualify. File the <a href="http://www.fafsa.ed.gov/">FAFSA</a> by February 1 to be considered for the maximum amount and types of financial aid. All students with complete financial aid applications should receive information about financial assistance by mid-April.

UMW Foundation scholarships are awarded in June and require the Scholarship Information Form (SIF). The SIF is available at the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid/">Office of Financial Aid</a> and on <a href="https://orgsync.com/home/551">myUMW</a> (in mid-May) to students who accept the offer of admission. <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/financialaid">Instructions and forms</a> are available and are year-specific. For more information, call the <a href="/directory/department/provost/enrollment/financial-aid/">Office of Financial Aid</a> at (540) 654-2468.
<h2>Payment Plans</h2>
The University of Mary Washington offers a wide variety of payment plans. For more information, call EaglePAY at (800) 609-8056 or contact the <a href="/directory/department/administration/finance/student-accounts/">Office of Student Accounts</a> at (540) 654-1250.
<h2>Change in Housing Status</h2>
Changes in residential status are granted in extremely unusual circumstances only. Should it become necessary for you to request a change in status from residential to commuting, or vice versa, your written request must be submitted to the associate dean in the Office of Admissions. Such requests will be considered by the Admissions Committee and a written decision will be sent to the student. Any student who is granted a change from residential to commuting status after May 1 will forfeit the $500 deposit and must then make an additional deposit of $250 to enroll as a commuting student.
