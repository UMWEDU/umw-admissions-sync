<strong>I understand my enrollment deposit will be used to hold my place in the future term and is not refundable. </strong>

Please note <strong><em>if</em></strong> you are a residential student, that $300 is a deposit which is released at the time of your first bill. The remaining $250 will be held as a security deposit until you move off campus or graduate and is used to cover miscellaneous or outstanding fees that may be on your account.
