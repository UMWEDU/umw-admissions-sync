Want to take your career in education to the next level? Twenty-first-century learners come in all shapes and sizes – gifted and talented, emotionally disabled, English language learners, you name it. They all need teachers who know how to reach them. UMW’s Master of Education for Professional Development and Added Endorsement programs let you choose the path you want to pursue and make you more marketable.
<h2>Is an M.Ed. for Professional Development or Added Endorsement right for me?</h2>
For licensed, practicing teachers who want to work with specific student populations, study educational leadership, or become literacy specialists, this program lends itself to continuing professional development, master’s level licensure, and endorsements in both teaching and administration.
<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
Choose from five distinct curriculums:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#diverse">Diverse Student Populations</a>. Enhance your skills in meeting the needs of various student populations, or choose to pursue the gifted education endorsement.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#leadership">Educational Leadership</a>. This cohort program is open for fall admission only. Course work, along with a passing score on the School Leaders License Assessment, fulfills administration and supervision endorsement requirements.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#literacy">Literacy Specialist</a>. This cohort program is open for spring admission only. Course work, along with a passing score on the Reading for Virginia Educators: Reading Specialist Assessment, leads to a reading specialist endorsement and highlights foundational knowledge, instructional strategies and curriculum development, assessment and intervention, literacy in communication, and literacy leadership.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#secondary">Secondary Mathematics</a>. This cohort program, for those with a strong background in undergraduate math, preferably a bachelor’s degree, prepares teachers to teach Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses, as well as high school-community college dual-enrollment courses.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#special">Special Education General Curriculum</a>. Pursue a degree and added licensure.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#special">Special Education Adapted Curriculum</a>. Pursue a degree and added licensure.</li>
	<li><a href="http://publications.umw.edu/graduatecatalog/graduate-programs/college-of-education/master-of-education/#esl">Teaching English as a Second Language</a>. Learn to better meet the needs of P-12 English language learners in public schools.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What careers will I be prepared for?</h2>
These programs lead to endorsements and more fulfilling careers in instructional technology, higher education, ESL, and more. Check out the options above.
<h2>When and how do I apply for acceptance to the program?</h2>
