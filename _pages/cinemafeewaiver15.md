The code may be used with your online application for admission to the University of Mary Washington. UMW uses <a href="https://apply.commonapp.org/Login?ma=159"><strong>The Common Application</strong></a> or <a href="https://applyweb.collegenet.com/account/new/create?origin=https://www.mycoalition.org/app">Coalition Application</a>. When asked on UMW specific questions, “Do you intend to use one of these school-specific fee waivers,” choose code <strong>UMW65</strong> from the drop down menu. The code will expire on February 1, 2018. Submit your application by Feb. 1 to maximize your admissions and scholarship opportunities.
