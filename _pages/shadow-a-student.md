These visits (for seniors only) are scheduled for one day, Monday through Friday, generally between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. This enables you to be on campus for all or part of a day when classes are in session in order to sample both the academic and community life of the University.  Our hosts are student volunteers who are active in many ways on campus. Guests are also permitted to attend classes or activities with the host’s friends when mutually agreeable.

Visits are scheduled mid-September through mid-November and mid-January through mid-April but not during fall and spring breaks or during exam times. Be sure to check our <a href="http://www.umw.edu/events"><strong>calendar</strong></a> so that you don’t plan your visit when classes are not in session.

Pick your visit day based on your academic interest with classes shown below. Please <a href="https://umw.askadmissions.net/Portal/EI/Search"><strong>register online</strong></a> or call Admissions at (540) 654-2000, especially if you’re interested in a class not shown below, biology for example.

<h3>University Policies:</h3>
UMW considers its guests responsible adults and expects them to demonstrate mature conduct. Our rules and regulations are not excessive, but each guest is required to abide by all University policies. Any failure to do so may result in dismissal from campus and review of the individual’s admission status. The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/"><strong>Student Handbook</strong></a> explains all regulations in detail. UMW is not responsible for accidental injury of guest.
