These visits <em>(for seniors and transfer students only</em>) are scheduled Monday through Friday, between the hours of 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. for either a morning or afternoon visit. This enables you to be on campus for when classes are in session in order to sample both the academic and community life of the University.  Our hosts are student volunteers who are active on campus. Guests are also permitted to attend classes or activities with the host’s friends when mutually agreeable.

Visits are scheduled mid-September through mid-November and mid-January through mid-April but not during fall and spring breaks or during exam times. Be sure to check our <a href="http://www.umw.edu/events"><strong>calendar</strong></a> so that you don’t plan your visit when classes are not in session.

Please <a href="https://admissions.umw.edu/portal/shadow_a_student"><strong>register online</strong></a> or call Admissions at (540) 654-2000. Because classes occur at different times, please email the office at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> the day before you are scheduled to verify your arrival time. <span style="color: #ff0000"><em>Please note: attending classes, lunch, and other activities/clubs are reserved for students ONLY.  </em></span>
<h3>What to bring:</h3>
Guests are also encouraged to bring a book, magazine, or schoolwork in case there is brief downtime should hosts need to prepare or work. The Office of Admissions issues one complimentary meal ticket for a day visit.
<h3>University Policies:</h3>
UMW considers its guests responsible adults and expects them to demonstrate mature conduct. Our rules and regulations are not excessive, but each guest is required to abide by all University policies. Any failure to do so may result in dismissal from campus and review of the individual’s admission status. The <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/student-handbook/"><strong>Student Handbook</strong></a> explains all regulations in detail. UMW is not responsible for accidental injury of guest.
