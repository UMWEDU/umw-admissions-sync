College is closer than you think! It’s time to start exploring the possibilities. We hope you’ll bring your great mind to the University of Mary Washington. More than that, though, we want you to find the school that’s the best fit for you.
<h2>Consider these tips to help keep you on track.</h2>
<div class="blocklistitem">
<div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">All is fair.</div> <span style="display: block;">Look for college fairs and representatives coming to your school or area, and get out there! Introduce yourself to representatives and ask them the questions you really want answered. What’s the best thing about their school? What majors do they offer? What’s the campus like?</span>
</div>

<div class="blocklistitem"><div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Chat it up.</div> Set aside some free time during winter break to talk with different groups of people about college. Ask relatives which schools they’d recommend. Talk to friends who’ve come home from college to see if their schools are meeting their expectations.
</div>

<div class="blocklistitem">
<div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Test time.</div>Plan to take the SAT I, SAT II, and/or ACT. Find out when and where the exams will be offered, and ask your guidance counselor for tips on how best to prepare. Taking the tests now gives you time to retake them next year if you’re unhappy with your results.</div>

<div class="blocklistitem"><div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Choose carefully.</div>Select senior-year courses wisely, with the college acceptance process in mind. Ask your guidance counselor for help signing up for classes that could put you on a career path, meet college requirements, or set you ahead of the pack, such as honors or advanced-placement courses.</div>

<div class="blocklistitem"><div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Hit the road.</div>It isn’t too early to visit some of the colleges you’re considering. Look for scheduled open houses, tours, and information sessions, or call in advance to make your own arrangements. Be sure to check out Mary Washington’s bustling and beautiful campus in historic Fredericksburg, Virginia, less than an hour from Washington, D.C.</div>

<div class="blocklistitem"><div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Boost your credentials.</div>Grades are key when it comes to getting into college, but admissions personnel also want motivated, well-rounded students. Make sure to slip some extracurricular activities – community involvement, sports, hobbies, clubs, volunteerism, student government experience – under your belt.</div>

<div class="blocklistitem"><div class="one-fourth first inlineAttention">Get on the list.</div>Sign up with colleges you’re considering to be included on their mailing lists and have materials delivered to you throughout the year.</div>
