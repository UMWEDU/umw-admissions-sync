<h2>Can I request to live in a specific residence hall?</h2>
You'll have the opportunity to indicate your building preferences on the Housing and Dining Services Agreement after you attend Orientation in June. While we do our best to meet your preferences, not everyone will receive his or her first-choice building.

<a href="http://admissions.umw.edu/youarein/files/2011/12/NS-UMW-42.jpg"><img class="alignleft wp-image-40311 size-medium" src="http://admissions.umw.edu/youarein/files/2011/12/NS-UMW-42-300x194.jpg" alt="Dining Hall" width="300" height="194" /></a>
<h2>Where can I eat on campus?</h2>
There are three places to eat on campus that serve everything from sushi to gelato to home cooking. <a href="http://www.umw.edu/life/campus-dining/">Find out</a> more about menus, locations, and hours of operation.
<h2>What are the EagleOne ID card features?</h2>
The card provides access to residential halls and operates as a debit card to allow purchases at the campus bookstore, health center, laundry, theater box office, library, print labs, and more. The card is also recognized by <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone/eagleone-off-campus-2/">off-campus merchants</a>. Check out the <a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone/eagleone-deposits/">instructions</a> for making a deposit online.
<h2>Does UMW offer weekend entertainment for students?</h2>
<a href="http://admissions.umw.edu/youarein/files/2011/12/6253-K-Pearlman-Photography1.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-40241 size-medium" src="http://admissions.umw.edu/youarein/files/2011/12/6253-K-Pearlman-Photography1-300x200.jpg" alt="Carl's Ice Cream" width="300" height="200" /></a>Yes! Every weekend is different at UMW. The Office of Student Activities and Engagement organizes a late-night Friday programming series involving anything from drive-in movies to themed dances and barbecues. Many clubs and organizations plan weekend events, host speakers, and offer fun activities for students. Giant Productions brings bands and comedians to campus, and Cheap Seats Cinema shows recently released blockbuster movies in Dodd Auditorium. For more information about what’s going on, check out the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/studentactivities/">Student Activities</a> site. If you’re looking for coffee, dollar-burger nights, homemade ice cream or even live music, check out some of the popular local downtown hangouts including Hyperion, Capital Ale House, Carl’s Ice Cream, Sammy T’s, and J Brian’s.
<h2>Can I purchase computers and software at academic prices?</h2>
Yes, the bookstore sells software for PCs and Macs at substantial academic discounts. For information about recommended computers, visit the <a href="http://bookstore.umw.edu/">bookstore’s</a> site.
<h2>Where will I purchase books?</h2>
UMW operates a bookstore in Lee Hall. All first-semester freshmen have an opportunity to enroll in a textbook reservation program. By enrolling in this program and depositing the required amount into an EagleOne account, the bookstore will obtain your class schedule, gather and pack your books, and deliver them to your residence hall or a central location for pickup. Textbook reservation gives you an early opportunity to reserve used textbooks and save money.
<h2>Can I request to live with a certain person?</h2>
Absolutely! Please bear in mind that requests can be honored only if both people request each other on their respective housing agreements.
<h2>How do meal plans work?</h2>
Visit the dining website to view <a href="http://www.umwdining.com/plans/index.html">meal plan options</a>.
<h2>Since cars aren’t allowed for freshmen, how do I get around?</h2>
We understand that this can be a real concern. Not only can students ride the Fredericksburg Regional Transit Bus (FRED) free with their student IDs, they also can take the Eagle Express. The University worked with the city of Fredericksburg to develop this special weekend bus that travels on a rotating hourly schedule from campus to downtown Fredericksburg, Spotsylvania Towne Centre, and Central Park shopping center. Historic downtown Fredericksburg is within walking distance of campus.
<h2>I live far away. How can I arrange transportation home?</h2>
UMW is minutes away from both a Greyhound bus station and an Amtrak rail station. Additionally, UMW is 50 miles from Washington, D.C., home to Reagan National, Dulles, and BWI airports.
