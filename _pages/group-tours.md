The University of Mary Washington is delighted to host special group visits on campus. We ask visiting school groups to limit the number of students to no more than 50 due to limited facility and staff resources.
<h2>Request a Visit</h2>
Please fill out the <a href="/admissions/visit/group-tours/schedule-a-group-tour/">Group Visit Request Form</a> so we may assist you in meeting your needs and provide a wonderful experience for you and your students. Information sessions and tours for special groups are held at 10:30 a.m. and 2 p.m. (Monday – Friday). If you have certain time restrictions on your trip itinerary, please describe the details on the request form so we may plan accordingly.
<h2>Plan Ahead</h2>
UMW recommends at least four weeks advanced notice in order to schedule a group tour and cannot guarantee your visit request will be honored. A representative from the Office of Admissions will follow up with your request and confirm via email and telephone.

To aid with your travel planning, we have <a href="/directory/building/lee-hall/">convenient driving directions</a> (via Google Maps) and a <a href="http://www.umw.edu/documents/document/map-of-fredericksburg-campus/">downloadable campus map</a>.

Please do not make any travel arrangements until you receive confirmation from UMW. If you have any questions, contact the admissions office by email at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> or by phone at (540) 654-2000 or 800-468-5614.
<h2>Join us for Lunch</h2>
If you plan to enjoy lunch on campus at the Dining Hall in the University Center, please be aware the reduced rate for groups is $6.90 per person. The Sodexo Company recommends groups pay by a single check or credit card to move through the line quickly. Please indicate on the request form if you would like to have lunch on campus and we will help coordinate the details.
