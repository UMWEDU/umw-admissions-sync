Craving a senior management role, a raise, or just more respect? An MBA from UMW gives you the confidence and credibility you’ll need to climb the corporate ladder or strike out on your own as a successful entrepreneur.
<h2>Is UMW’s MBA program right for me?<strong>
</strong></h2>
The Master of Business Administration within UMW’s College of Business is a great choice for new and experienced professionals who want to assume management and leadership positions in a variety of organizational settings. Candidates should – but are not required to – possess two or more years of professional or technical work experience.
<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
Designed to produce creative leaders and facilitated by a faculty with extensive business experience and academic credentials, UMW’s MBA gives you the knowledge and skills it takes to manage the technical and human sides of organizations. Combine core courses that foster leadership, teamwork, and problem-solving with electives that advance personal goals. Gain an understanding of best practices in the competitive business environment. Meet successful guest speakers and network with classmates.
<h2>What careers will I be prepared for?</h2>
MBAs lead government agencies and Fortune 500s. They’re analysts, consultants, executives, and entrepreneurs. Some top career picks for MBAs include information security analyst, human resources specialist, management analyst, IT manager, and operations research analyst. Recent graduates of UMW’s MBA program have landed positions with organizations such as Boeing, Booz Allen Hamilton, Citibank, Geico, General Dynamics, Intuit, Lockheed Martin, JP Morgan Chase, and Northrop Grumman.
<h2>How long will it take to complete the program?</h2>
UMW offers courses in its MBA program in a variety of formats and locations, including an evening program at our Stafford and Dahlgren campuses designed with those with job and family responsibilities in mind. Most classes meet one night per week for eight weeks. Take a full course load to finish in two years, or take a course at a time. You are allowed six years to complete the degree.
<h2>When and how do I apply for acceptance to the program?</h2>
To enroll during the fall semester, the suggested filing date is Aug. 1. (All students applying for graduate assistant positions must apply for fall admission by March 1.) For spring, the suggested filing date is Nov. 15. For summer, it’s April 1. UMW accepts post-filing date applications on a rolling, space-available basis.

Get a head start on your courses by signing up for the second eight-week session of the fall semester, which begins in October, or of the spring semester, which begins in March. Or join the MBA program as a non-degree seeking student.
