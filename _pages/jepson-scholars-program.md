This program includes a <strong>four year academic scholarship</strong> and <strong>two paid, hands-on research experiences</strong> that will help students develop skills for careers and post-graduate studies in the natural sciences. Ten scholars will be selected for matriculation in 2019-20. Students must have demonstrated need as determined by the FAFSA. Preference is given to students who apply Early Action by November 15.
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
3.75 GPA, 1150 SAT or 25 ACT; selection will be holistic, and students not meeting these criteria may be considered.
<h4>Scholarships</h4>
Four year academic scholarship for students majoring in one of the programs housed under Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Earth and Environmental Sciences, or Physics. Scholarships will range from $4,000 to $10,000/year depending on unmet need (anticipated average is $7,500). Scholars must maintain a 3.00 cumulative GPA, major in an appropriate program, and participate in Jepson Scholar activities.
<h4>Programmatic Aspects</h4>
Jepson Scholars will participate in a variety of activities to promote skills and abilities to prepare Scholars for success in their majors and subsequent careers.
<ol>
 	<li>Scholars will participate in the <strong>Jepson Scholar Early Active STEM Experience (EASE)</strong> – a 5 week residential program the summer before their first year at UMW where they will integrate with a faculty and student team to conduct cutting-edge research in the sciences ($1,000 stipend and room and board).</li>
 	<li>Scholars will enroll as a cohort in science-themed First-Year Seminars, ensuring that their academic advisors will be from one of the science departments. Students will also enroll as a cohort in their introductory science courses and will <strong>participate in Peer Assisted Study Sessions</strong> (PASS) for key first-year science courses like General Chemistry and Physics.</li>
 	<li>Scholars will participate in field trips, workshops, and symposia sponsored by the Center for Career and Professional Development to prepare them for careers in the sciences or post-graduate studies.</li>
 	<li>Scholars will participate in the <strong>UMW Summer Science Institute</strong>, a ten week intensive research experience, as rising juniors or seniors (<strong>$2,800 stipend, room and board, research supply funding</strong>).</li>
