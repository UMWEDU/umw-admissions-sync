<h2>Apply to join UMW’s Bachelor of Liberal Studies program!</h2>
What are you waiting for? UMW’s Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS) degree, for nontraditional adult students, lets you turn your professional and life experience into academic credit, earn a degree, and boost your marketability.

If you’re trying to decide if the BLS is right for you, check out this list of frequently asked questions.
<h3>Do I qualify for UMW’s Bachelor of Liberal Studies Program?</h3>
To apply to the program, you must:
<ul>
 	<li>Be able to demonstrate the ability to succeed in college-level course work by accumulating at least 30 transferable credits with a minimum GPA of 2.5 on a 4-point scale.</li>
 	<li>Fit into one of the following categories:
<ul>
 	<li>graduated from high school six or more years ago</li>
 	<li>veteran or active-duty member of the U.S. armed services</li>
 	<li>have legal dependents other than a spouse</li>
 	<li>financially self-supporting</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What can I major in?</h3>
At UMW, BLS students receive a well-rounded liberal arts and sciences education, exploring an array of subjects in the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Choose from more than <a href="http://publications.umw.edu/undergraduatecatalog/courses-of-study/majors/ldms/">30 majors</a>, including Leadership and Management, which is unique to the BLS program. BLS students also can double major, or work with the BLS office and UMW faculty to design their own major and degree plan.
<h3>How can I learn more about the Leadership and Management program?</h3>
The Leadership and Management degree is unique to UMW’s BLS program. For more information, click on the link above or contact Ana Garcia Chichester at (540) 654-1989 or <a href="mailto:achiches@umw.edu"><u>achiches@umw.edu</u></a>.
<h3>Do all the credits I transfer have to have been earned in the traditional way?</h3>
No. One of the great things about UMW’s Bachelor of Liberal Studies program is that it allows adult learners to cash in on their real-life experiences, converting professional, military, and other credentials into academic credit. The BLS program allows students to transfer a maximum of 90 credits, including a maximum of 30 credits earned through military service and a maximum of 30 credits earned through a life/work portfolio.
<h3>How many credits do I need to complete UMW’s BLS program?</h3>
The BLS degree requires a minimum of 120 semester hours in three categories: general education, courses that meet the requirements of your chosen major, and electives.
<h3>Where and when are classes held?</h3>
Students in the BLS program attend classes on the Fredericksburg campus and, sometimes, on the Stafford campus on U.S. 17 North, that follow the regular schedule of the College of Arts and Sciences (for most majors) and/or the College of Business (for the major in Leadership and Management). Most classes meet during the day, but a limited selection of evening classes also is offered. The Stafford campus offers two eight-week evening sessions during the semester.
<h3>What if I have other questions?</h3>
