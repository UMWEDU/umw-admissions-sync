Our general education requirements reflect Mary Washington’s distinctive liberal arts and sciences values, an important part of which is <strong>Intermediate Competency </strong>in a language other than English.  For many students this means completing through the 202 or 205 level in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, or Spanish.

In order to move through the sequence of language courses at UMW<strong>, first-time students</strong> should begin their language study at the appropriate level. The Department of Modern Languages offers a placement exam in <strong>Arabic, Mandarin Chinese, French, German, Italian and Spanish</strong>.

Our placement exam is administered through Avant Placement. New students <strong><span style="color: #ff0000">will need to take the exam at home between May 1 and June 1, 2017</span>. </strong>Students will be notified of their scores and recommended placement at Orientation. Students who score high in the summer will be invited to take another proctored exam at the beginning of the fall semester if they wish to seek exemption from the UMW language requirement. Otherwise, they can take the recommended course. <em>NOTE: The <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/academicservices/placement-testing/">Latin placement exam</a> must be taken by July 15</em>.

<strong>You should only take a placement exam for a language that you have previously studied in high school.</strong> If you plan to start with a new language that you have never studied, do not take a placement exam. You should register for the 101 course in that language.

<strong>It is important to do well on this exam. </strong>Students who start at the lowest level will be taking 12 credits total to complete language requirement. Testing into a higher level of language means more room for major or minor courses, or proceeding more quickly to advanced language studies. Students can prepare for the exam by reviewing previous language study, and by taking the Avant practice exam.

By taking this test you are bound by the <strong>University of Mary Washington Honor Code.</strong> This means, that you are on your honor to take the placement test by yourself using no assistance during the test. You will not use any reference materials, nor will you have another person help you. Likewise, you are not to download, print out, or in any way save this test.

The equipment you will need for the exam include a PC, Mac, or Chromebook computer; a headset with microphone; and Internet Explorer, Chrome, or Safari internet browsers. For more information about the test and the technical requirements and to take a practice exam, <strong>please see this page before taking the Avant PLACE test: </strong><a href="http://technology.umw.edu/helpdesk/language-placement-exam-support/">http://technology.umw.edu/helpdesk/language-placement-exam-support/</a>

You need to allow about 45 minutes to complete the test. You will find out your scores and your recommended placement at orientation.
