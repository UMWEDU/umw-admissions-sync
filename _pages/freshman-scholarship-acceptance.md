<strong>Acceptance Certificate must be returned to the Office of Admissions by May 1.</strong>

The recipient qualifies to receive a scholarship for each of four academic years (Fall/Spring) of continuous undergraduate study at the University of Mary Washington provided that all of the following conditions are satisfied:
<ol>
	<li>The recipient will receive a scholarship for each academic year that the qualifications are met.  One-half of the scholarship will be credited each semester to the student’s account.  Awards are dependent on domicile status in Virginia or another state.  Virginia residency is based on responses to residency questions on the application for admission or the Virginia In-state Tuition Rates (VIT) form.  Awards may be changed in the event domicile is changed after awarding.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
	<li>The recipient must be a full-time residence hall student at the University of Mary Washington, except in the specific case of a pre-approved study abroad program as detailed or if the student’s original status is that of a commuting student.  For purposes of this scholarship, the student must successfully complete at least 12 credit hours each semester.  Scholarships may be reduced or withdrawn for students changing from residential to commuter.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
	<li>The scholarship may be used for pre-approved study abroad programs for current scholars who have maintained eligibility for the scholarship prior to their study abroad experience.  Pre-approval requires that written permission from the Office of Academic Services be sent to the Office of Financial Aid.  Participation will be limited to one period of study, not to exceed two semesters.  Study abroad credit hours equivalent to full-time enrollment will be transferred back to the University of Mary Washington and used to consider scholarship eligibility for the subsequent year.  Study abroad participants must return to the University of Mary Washington as full-time residence hall students to complete their degree requirements.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
	<li>The scholarship may not be used by students participating in an internship in which the student resides off campus.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
	<li>The recipient must achieve a grade point average of at least 2.5 on a 4.0 grade point system for the first academic year.  In subsequent years, the recipient must maintain a yearly grade point average (not cumulative average) of at least 2.75 on a 4.0 scale for 30-59 credit hours, at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale for 60 credit hours or more.  The grade point average is to be determined by the course load requirement used in the determination of Dean’s List students.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
	<li>Should the recipient be placed on social or administrative probation, or be found guilty of an Honor Code violation, the scholarship will be withdrawn, and charges to the student shall be adjusted according to the University’s refund policy.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
	<li>Should the recipient withdraw during the academic year, an adjustment in the amount of the scholarship will be made according to the University’s refund policy.</li>
</ol>
