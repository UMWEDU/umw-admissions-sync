You’ve come this far! Once you’re ready to apply for acceptance to UMW’s Master of Education with Initial Teacher Licensure program, this checklist will help you make sure you have everything you need:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/COE-grad-app.pdf">College of Education Graduate Program Application</a> and $50 application fee or fee waiver.<strong> <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/umw/">Apply online</a>, and we’ll waive the fee.</strong></li>
	<li>An undergraduate degree from a regionally accredited college or university.</li>
	<li>An official transcript (in its original sealed envelope or via secure e-transcript sent directly from the institution) from every college or university you’ve attended even if the courses were transferred to another institution. Competitive applicants are encouraged to have a cumulative GPA of 2.5 or higher on undergraduate course work and/or a 3.0 cumulative GPA on graduate course work.</li>
	<li>A résumé outlining experiences and education, including any paid <em>and </em>volunteer experience related to education, such as coaching, religious teaching, work with Scouts, etc. Candidates who have completed their bachelor’s degree in the past 12 months and do not have three years of work experience must complete the M.Ed.</li>
	<li>An interview may be required.</li>
	<li>Passing <a href="http://www.ets.org/praxis/about/core/">PRAXIS core</a> – reading, writing, math – test scores (or passing scores from <a href="http://education.umw.edu/student-resources/testing-requirements-2/">other qualifying tests</a>, such as SAT and ACT). <strong>Use UMW Praxis code 5394.</strong></li>
