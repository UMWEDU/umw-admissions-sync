<h2>Put your professional experience to work for you!</h2>
The University of Mary Washington offers the <a href="/admissions/adult/bls/">Bachelor of Liberal Studies (BLS)</a> and the <a href="/admissions/adult/bsn/">Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN)</a> Degree Completion Program for adult learners who want to grow their careers and gain some traction from the professional experience they’ve already gained.
<h3>Interested in the BLS?</h3>
Designed for nontraditional adult students who want to complete a bachelor’s degree, UMW’s <a href="/admissions/adult/bls/">Bachelor of Liberal Studies</a> program offers greater flexibility than a traditional bachelor’s degree and helps you translate your career and life experience into academic credit. Students enroll full or part time, are not required to live on campus, and skip the foreign language requirements of the traditional curriculum’s general education component.

BLS students receive a well-rounded education, exploring an array of subjects in the arts, humanities, and natural and social sciences. Choose from more than 30 majors in the liberal arts and sciences, including <a href="/study/areas/leadership-and-management-studies/">Leadership and Management</a> and <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/bls/bls-major-programs-of-study/criminal-justice-special-major/">Criminal Justice</a> which are exclusive to the BLS program; double major; or work with the <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/bls/">BLS office</a> and UMW faculty to create your own major and degree plan.
<h3>Want to learn more about the BSN?</h3>
Designed as a completion program for registered nurses who hold an associate’s degree, UMW’s <a href="/admissions/adult/bsn/">Bachelor of Nursing Degree Completion Program</a> prepares graduates to identify and improve patient care within a complex healthcare system, to assume more vital roles within the medical profession, and to continue their nursing education to the graduate level. Online hybrid classes make it easy to enroll full time to complete the program in just one year, or study on a part-time basis.

The <a href="/admissions/adult/bsn/bsn-curriculum/">curriculum</a> combines UMW’s tradition of liberal arts with American Association of Colleges of Nursing, <em>Essentials of Baccalaureate Education for Professional Nursing Practice</em>, recommendations. Students take three liberal arts courses and seven higher level nursing courses, and receive valuable mentorships from UMW faculty and nursing leaders in the Fredericksburg community.
