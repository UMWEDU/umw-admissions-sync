	<li>An official transcript from every college or university you’ve attended even if the courses were transferred to another institution.</li>
	<li>An undergraduate degree from an accredited college or university with a GPA of 2.5 or higher (a GPA of 2.75 or higher is required for acceptance into the educational leadership program) on undergraduate course work and/or 3.0 or higher on graduate course work.</li>
