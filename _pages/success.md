We’re looking forward to receiving your application to transfer to the University of Mary Washington. If accepted, we want you to start out set for success. The following will help you prepare for the rigorous academics you’ll encounter at UMW:
<h2>Make the grade:</h2>
Keep working to keep your grades as high as you can. Transfer students are encouraged to maintain a GPA of 3.0 or higher and to have completed at least 15 semester hours.
<h2>Decisions, decisions:</h2>
Choose courses carefully. Our Admissions team considers the types of courses you’ve already completed.
<h2>Write on:</h2>
Take a college composition or writing course. UMW’s writing intensive program is, well, intense. Get in as much practice as you can.
<h2>Count on it:</h2>
Pre-calculus won’t cut it here at Mary Washington. Courses that count toward UMW’s math requirement include math for liberal arts, finite math, calculus, and some statistics courses.
<h2>An exact science:</h2>
UMW’s science requirement calls for completion of a lab science, in sequence. Choose from biology, chemistry, geology, and physics, and complete part one before signing up for part two.
<h2>Talking points:</h2>
All UMW students must show intermediate-level competence in a spoken foreign language. You can do this by completing the 202-level of a language, passing the department’s entrance exam, or with <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/transfer-information/transferring-credit-ap-ib-or-previous-coursework/freshmen-advanced-placement-ap-credit/">Advanced Placement</a> or <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/transfer-information/transferring-credit-ap-ib-or-previous-coursework/freshmen-international-baccalaureate-ib-credit/">International Baccalaureate</a> credits.
