Our master’s of science program in geospatial analysis is one of just two of its type in Virginia. Based on the science behind your car’s GPS, this red-hot field uses Earth-surface data to solve real-world problems. Convenient evening classes prepare you for a career with the FBI, NASA, and other high-profile agencies … in defense, crisis management, the environment, and more. Use <em>your</em> degree to chart your <em>own</em> course.
<h2>Is UMW’s master’s of science degree in geospatial analysis right for me?</h2>
UMW’s MSGA is intended for those with experience in geographic information systems – recent graduates with a major, minor, certificate, or multiple courses in geospatial technology and professionals already working in geospatial fields.
<h2>What will I learn?</h2>
Master teachers employ theory and technical training to build your critical thinking, project management, and communication skills. Learn to ask and answer spatial questions; master technologies like geographic information systems, remote sensing, and GPS; and capture, analyze, and map locational data from original research and from agencies like the Census Bureau, NASA, and the FBI.<strong>
</strong>
<h2>What careers will I be prepared for?</h2>
An MSGA will give you the competitive advantage you need to advance your career and prepare you for work in any field where location is important. Named a high-growth area by the U.S. Department of Labor, geospatial analysis is particularly relevant in Virginia and in nearby Maryland and Washington, D.C. Launch an exciting career in intelligence, crime analysis, disaster management, emergency preparedness, crisis management, urban and regional planning, architecture, engineering, technical consulting, environmental resource management, scientific research, health specialties, government, cartography, surveying, geovisualization, photogrammetry, and more.
<h2>How long will it take to complete the program?</h2>
Full-time students can complete UMW’s MSGA program in just one year. Part-time students who take at least one class per semester can finish in three. Evening classes make the program accessible to working adults.
<h2>When and how do I apply for acceptance to the program?</h2>
The suggested filing date for the fall semester is June 1. (Students applying for graduate assistant positions must apply by March 1.) For spring, the suggested filing date is Oct. 1. UMW accepts post-filing date applications on a rolling, space-available basis.

<h2>What are industry experts saying about UMW’s MSGA program?</h2>
<blockquote>The work that the Eastern Geology and Paleoclimate Science Center (EGPSC) does would be difficult to accomplish without the support of staff trained in geospatial technologies. [UMW’s MSGA] program will provide students with the necessary skills to fulfill the growing needs of a variety of geospatial science positions within the federal government, including those here within the EGPSC.
<div class="quoted">- Peter G. Chirico, Research Geographer</div></blockquote>
<blockquote>BAE Systems has over 30 years of experience providing full-spectrum analytic and production support to the Department of Defense, much of which is GIS and geospatially focused. The cadre of [UMW] MSGA graduates would immensely strengthen our GIS candidate pipeline for future proposal efforts and aid in filling current senior positions locally and across the nation.
