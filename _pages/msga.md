The program provides students with a technical foundation and geographic knowledge base to apply geospatial tools to a myriad of problems such as crime analysis, transportation engineering, urban planning, emergency preparedness, resource management, facilities management, climate change, and marketing.

This is a coherent program designed to assure the mastery of specific knowledge and skills, such as programming within a geospatial environment, report writing, critical spatial analysis and solving problems. Capstone projects have been completed on diverse topics including visualization, sea level change, conservation, climate and ecosystem modeling, health issues, urbanization and flooding, landscape reconstruction and more. The MSGA offers a learning and growth opportunity within driving distance of some of the nation’s leading government and corporate geospatial agencies.
