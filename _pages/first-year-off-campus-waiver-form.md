UMW’s mission as a public university is to provide a residential college experience.  As such, students are expected to live on campus for their first two years to be fully supported in their transition to college life.

UMW is also committed to our local students who may choose to live at home with family for a variety of reasons. The university has designated a thirty-mile radius of the Fredericksburg campus to be an acceptable commuting distance to allow students to drive in daily from home.

Students outside of the thirty-mile radius of campus are expected to live on campus for the first two years.  Students outside of the thirty mile radius who wish to remain living with family must request and be approved for a waiver to live off campus.

If you would like to commute as a first-year student, and you live more than thirty miles from campus, please complete the form below to request a waiver to live off campus.  Your request will be reviewed by a committee whose members represent Admissions, Financial Aid, Student Affairs, and Academic Affairs.
