Ambassadors will be trained before attending a college fair or helping at an event. Don't worry about the training though because prospective students want to hear from you about your experiences!
<h4>UMW is looking for alums to regionally recruit in the following capacities:</h4>
<strong>College Fairs</strong>
College fairs usually take place at local high schools or colleges, and most feature 50-150 representatives from technical schools to colleges and universities. Each school is assigned a table in a large room such as a gymnasium or cafeteria. For about 1.5-3 hours, students and parents will walk the room, gathering materials, and ask questions. Most questions involve admissions requirements, academic programs, scholarships, financial aid, cost, and location.

<strong>Refer an Eagle</strong>
Do you know a high school senior or transfer student that would thrive at Mary Washington? Share an application fee waiver code to waive the $50 application fee on the Common Application for admission to encourage the student to apply.

Give the student the code UMW51. He or she will select this code from a drop down menu on the application within the UMW questions when prompted. Let Admissions know with whom you have shared the code. Send us an email at admit@umw.edu indicating the student’s full name, email address if you have it, and your name.

<strong>Regional Alumni Yield Receptions</strong>
Attend an afternoon reception and welcome admitted students and their parents. Receptions are held in the spring. You’ll get to share your experiences and how attending Mary Washington prepared you in your career.

<strong>Open House Interviews</strong>
During the fall, interviews are conducted for high school seniors during the Open House events on Saturdays. Each interview takes approximately 20 minutes. Interviews are not required, but will place students in consideration for a “Taking Flight” scholarship that ranges between $1,000-$2,000. Interviews are reserved for high school seniors for fall 2020 admission candidates. Students must apply by the February 1 Regular Admission filing date and the interview must be completed by February 1 for consideration.

<strong>Regional Interviews</strong>
If students can’t make it to campus to interview, they can let an Admissions staff member know and we can can see if an alum is available to meet them regionally.

<strong>Calls to Admitted Students</strong>
Connect with admitted students over the phone and share your experiences. You can let them know why you chose UMW, professors that you connected with, activities that you were involved in and how your experiences shaped who you are and helped you in your career.
