Ambassadors will be trained before attending a college fair or helping at an event. Don't worry about the training though because prospective students want to hear from you about your experiences!
<h4>UMW is looking for alums to regionally recruit in the following capacities:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li>College Fairs</li>
 	<li>Refer an Eagle</li>
 	<li>Regional Alumni Yield Receptions</li>
 	<li>Open House Interviews</li>
 	<li>Regional Interviews</li>
 	<li>Calls to Admitted Students</li>
</ul>
<h4>Participation Cycle</h4>
Summer – Alumni Ambassador training
Fall – college fairs and interviews
Winter – personal outreach, targeted calls to admitted and deposited students
Spring – regional yield events where and when possible
Time commitment: no more than twenty hours per quarter.
