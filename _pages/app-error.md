<h3>Application Error</h3>
Are you getting an error?

If you log into your account and get the message "There are no application types currently available," it is likely because you have an application already started. Click the <a href="https://admissions.umw.edu/apply/?sr=136e0bf9-e702-4eae-852a-8bfaf871b4bb">link</a> on the bottom that reads UMW Graduate Application to finish your application.
