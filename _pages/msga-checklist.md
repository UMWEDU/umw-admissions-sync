You’ve come this far! Once you’re ready to apply for acceptance to UMW’s Master of Science in Geospatial Analysis program, this checklist will help you make sure you have everything you need:
<ul>
	<li><a href="/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/MSGA-Application.pdf">MSGA Admissions Application</a> (pdf) and $50 application fee or fee waiver. <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/umw/">Apply online</a>, and we’ll waive the fee!</li>
	<li>An official transcript from every college or university you’ve attended, even if the courses were transferred to another institution.</li>
	<li>A current résumé, noting any applicable GIS or geospatial-related experience.</li>
	<li>A personal goal statement.</li>
	<li>Two recommendations. Use the forms provided on the Application to Admission.</li>
	<li><strong>International students</strong> should also submit their <a href="http://www.umw.edu/documents/document/request-for-form-i-20/">Request for Form I-20</a> (for F-1 visa candidates), <a href="/admissions/international/graduate-school/">International Transcript Evaluation</a>, and demonstration of English Language Proficiency.</li>
