<h2>How will I know which credits will transfer to UMW?</h2>
The <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/">Office of the Registrar</a> will provide an evaluation of your transfer credits, using <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/transfer-information/">UMW’s Transfer Credit Guide</a>. Typically, transfer credit is granted for similar courses taught on the same level and under the same general guidelines as UMW courses.
<h2>How many credits can I transfer to UMW?</h2>
As many as 90 transferred semester credit hours can be counted toward undergraduate degree programs.
<h2>What other guidelines apply when transferring credits to UMW?</h2>
No more than half the requirements for the major program you choose can be from transferred credits. Transfer students must complete a minimum of 30 credits, including 15 of the final 21, at UMW. Transferred credit must not overlap work done at UMW.
<h2>How many credit hours will I need to earn a BA or BS at UMW?</h2>
You must complete 120 semester hours of credit – from general education and major requirements, along with electives – to receive a bachelor of arts or science degree from UMW.
<h2>What are some things that prohibit the acceptance of credits?</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Earning less than a C in a course.</li>
	<li>Taking the course through correspondence, co-op, or home or independent study.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Will my GPA at UMW reflect my performance at other schools?</h2>
Transfer credits and grades will be recorded on your permanent record at UMW, but grades earned prior to UMW aren’t calculated into the cumulative GPA and don’t affect it in any way.
<h2>What if I’ve already earned a bachelor’s degree from UMW?</h2>
If you’ve earned a bachelor’s degree from Mary Washington, you may complete an additional major and have it noted on your permanent record. However, if the second degree you wish to pursue is a different type than the first (for example, if you’ve earned a BA or BLS, but now wish to pursue a BS), you must apply for admission for the second degree and earn at least 30 additional credits at UMW, including the major and general education requirements in the current academic catalogue.
<h2>What if I’ve already earned a bachelor’s degree elsewhere?</h2>
A student with a bachelor’s degree from another institution must enter UMW as a transfer student and complete the major and general education program requirements.
