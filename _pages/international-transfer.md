Congratulations! You’ve embarked on your life-altering journey into higher education in the United States … but sometimes things change. Sometimes we find that the course we chose first isn’t quite right. Sometimes another path comes to the surface, a path that seems to fit better with our plans for the future.

With its liberal arts and sciences curriculum, rigorous academics, passionate master teachers, and incredible sense of community, the University of Mary Washington could be the best path for you. UMW welcomes international transfer students – ones who have previously enrolled at another college or university, either inside or outside the United States – of all ethnic backgrounds.

All transfer students, regardless of nationality, need above average grades and strong skills in math, lab and social sciences, English, and foreign language to succeed at UMW. Here’s a quick overview of what international transfer students need to get started.
<h2>When!</h2>
Suggested application filing dates for international transfer students:
<ul>
	<li>Spring admission, Oct. 15</li>
	<li>Summer admission, March 1</li>
	<li>Fall admission, April 1</li>
</ul>
<em>UMW accepts applications received after suggested filing dates on a rolling, space-available basis. </em>
<h2>What!</h2>
To apply for admission to the University of Mary Washington, you’ll need to send us some important stuff. The <a href="/admissions/international/first-year-process/">International Admissions Process</a> and the<a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/international/international-checklist/"> International Admissions Checklist</a> pages include the bulk of documents and proficiencies needed to apply to UMW. International transfer students should also submit:
<ul>
	<li>A <a href="http://international.umw.edu/international-services/prospective/sevis-transfer-i-20-request-form/">SEVIS Transfer I-20 Request Form</a>. The Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (<a href="http://www.ice.gov/sevis/overview">SEVIS</a>) is how the Department of Homeland Security maintains information on Student and Exchange Visitor Program-certified schools and students who enter the U.S. to attend them.</li>
	<li>Copy of the front and back of your current Form I-94</li>
	<li>Financial verification document, original bank statement(s)</li>
	<li>Copy of your passport photo page</li>
	<li>If you currently attend a college or university <strong>inside</strong> the United States, you’ll also need to submit a Visa Transfer Clearance Form.</li>
</ul>
<em>NOTE: If your immigration status is derived from someone else, such as a parent or spouse, please include the supporting documents of the primary visa holder.</em>
<h2>Where!</h2>
Documents can be mailed to Office of Admissions, University of Mary Washington, 1301 College Ave., Fredericksburg, VA 22401. They can also be scanned or faxed to (540) 654-1857.
