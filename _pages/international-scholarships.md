Upon admission, international students are automatically considered for a merit scholarship between $1,000 and $9,000 USD based on high school academic record.Â  This scholarship is renewable for up to three additional years of continuous undergraduate study at UMW.

Graduates of International Language Academy (ILA) coming to UMW directly are eligible for scholarships.

Scholarships are determined based on the academic record provided with the application for admission. No additional scholarship application is necessary for merit consideration. Scholarship awards will be included in the official offer of admission to the university.
