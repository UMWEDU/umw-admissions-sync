Upon admission, international students are automatically considered for a $5,000 USD scholarship, based on a high school GPA of 3.0 or higher on a 4.0 scale.Â This scholarship is renewable for up to three additional years of undergraduate study at UMW.

Graduates of International Language Academy (ILA) coming to UMW directly are eligible for scholarships. Check back soon for specific details.

Scholarship awards will be included in the official offer of admission to the University.
