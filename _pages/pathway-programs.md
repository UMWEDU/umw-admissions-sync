<h3>Five Year Initial Licensure Pathways</h3>
The College of Education offers five five-year (bachelor's + master's + teaching license) programs. Students begin education coursework and field experiences at the undergraduate level, graduate with their class receiving their bachelor’s degree with a liberal arts or sciences major, and return for one more year during which they complete graduate education coursework, an internship, and a research study. Each program concludes with a Masters degree. Students in Elementary Education earn a Master's in Science (M.S.) and the Secondary, PreK-12 and Special Education pathways earn a Master's in Education (M.Ed.).
