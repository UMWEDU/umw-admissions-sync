Within the application, first year applicants to the University of Mary Washington may request to be considered for admission to the university without standardized test scores. <strong>Students offered admission under the test choice process may qualify for curriculum-based scholarships determined by the strength of their curriculum and their performance within their classes (GPA)</strong>.  Curriculum-based scholarships are renewable and range from $1,000-$4,000 for Virginia residents, and $5,000-$9,000 for non-Virginia residents. Students applying test choice may qualify for other endowed scholarships. To be considered for curriculum based scholarships, first year students must meet the February 1 admissions filing date.

<strong>Exceptions to test optional review include</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Students applying for admission to the Pre-Nursing (1+2+1 plan) Program</li>
 	<li>Students applying for merit based scholarships (full-ride Washington and Alvey Scholarships, Presidential, Eagle, and Blue-Gray Awards)</li>
 	<li>Home-schooled applicants</li>
 	<li>Candidates applying from schools that provide written evaluations rather than grades</li>
</ul>
Admission to UMW remains a competitive process, and all candidates for admission will be considered on their own merits. Qualifying for application review without submitting standardized test scores does <strong>not</strong> guarantee admission to UMW. Students interested in pre-nursing can apply test optional, but may be required to provide SAT or ACT scores for admission to the Nursing Program.
