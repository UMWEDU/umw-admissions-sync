Within the application, first year applicants to the University of Mary Washington may request to be considered for admission to the university without standardized test scores. <strong>Students offered admission under the test choice process may qualify for curriculum-based scholarships determined by the strength of their curriculum and their performance within their classes (GPA)</strong>.Â  Curriculum-based scholarships are renewable and range from $1,500-$5,000 for Virginia residents, and $5,000-$9,000 for non-Virginia residents planning to live on campus. To be considered for curriculum-based scholarships, first year students must meet the February 1 application filing date. Students applying test choice may also qualify for other endowed scholarships.

<strong>Exceptions to test choice review include</strong>:
<ul>
 	<li>Students applying for admission to the Pre-Nursing Program with less than a 3.5 cumulative GPA.</li>
</ul>
<div>
<div>While COVID continues to impact standardized test seat inventory, UMW is temporarily suspending the requirement of test scores for:</div>
<div>
<ul>
 	<li>Home-schooled applicants</li>
 	<li>Candidates applying from schools that provide written evaluations rather than grades</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
Admission to UMW remains a competitive process, and all candidates for admission will be considered on their own merits. Qualifying for application review without submitting standardized test scores does <strong>not</strong> guarantee admission to UMW. Students interested in pre-nursing can apply test choice, but may be required to provide SAT or ACT scores for admission to the Nursing Program.
