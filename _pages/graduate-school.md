<h1 style="font-size: 1.875rem; font-weight: bold;">Graduate Admissions for International Students</h1>
We can’t wait to see your fresh face at UMW, hear your bright ideas in our classrooms, and get your unique perspectives in our labs. We might even be more excited than you are, but embarking on an international graduate education takes planning. Here are some of the things you’ll need:

<strong>A completed <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/apply/">application</a></strong>, essay, and $50 USD application fee. Keep in mind the suggested <a href="/admissions/graduate/deadlines/">application filing dates for graduate programs</a>.

An official transcript evaluation from an agency recognized either by the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services or the American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers.

<strong>Proof of English proficiency</strong> by submitting one of the following:
<ul>
	<li>Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) with a composite score of at least 88 TOEFL IBT or at least 570 paper-based.</li>
	<li>International English Language Testing System (IELTS) with a score of 6.5 on the academic exam.</li>
	<li>Certificate of Completion from the ELS Language Center’s Intensive English Program, including Level 112, English for Academic Purposes</li>
</ul>
<strong>Proof of ability to pay.</strong> All students must be able to demonstrate that they can pay for their academic and living expenses while in the United States. (UMW does not provide graduate student housing). After you’ve been admitted and paid the deposit, next steps can be found on the <a href="http://international.umw.edu/">Center for International Education</a> site.

See the <a href="/admissions/international/international-checklist/">International Admissions Checklist</a> for a complete list of required documents.
