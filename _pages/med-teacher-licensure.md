<h3>What will I learn?</h3>
Through basic course work and field experiences prescribed by Virginia Licensure Regulations (VLR), teacher candidates learn to demonstrate and apply the teaching and subject knowledge competencies in the VLR and demonstrated by skillful teachers. You’ll acquire an initial teaching license and receive the support, supervision, evaluation, and advising you need to pinpoint the type of educator you want to become. You will learn to teach for understanding, focus on the nature of the learner, make critical decisions, master content expertise, and create a motivating classroom culture. Students gain experience and skill in monitoring professional growth through research, reflection, and problem solving. Most courses require students to complete field experiences in public schools.<strong>
