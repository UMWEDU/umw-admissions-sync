<h2>Parent’s Summer Chat Series</h2>
We’re excited to have your student on campus!  To help you navigate the transition of your student joining the UMW community, we’re scheduling a Chat Series for parents that will occur this summer.

<a href="https://umw.askadmissions.net/groupchat/LandingPage.aspx">Sign on to join a scheduled chat</a>. You’ll be able to join the chat 10 minutes prior to the start time. Please use your student’s name to sign onto the chat and enter the private code that can be found in your email.

June 6 - Orientation. Enter code 1682.

June 25 - Off campus students. Enter code 1683

July 11 - Financial Aid. Enter code 1684.

July 18 - Shopping for College. Enter code 1685.

July 31 - Transfer Students. Enter code 1686.

August 8 - What to Expect on Move-In Day. Enter code 1687.

We hope you join us to learn how you can support your student from home.  Whether home is Stafford County, VA or San Diego, CA, they are transitioning to their new routine just as you are transitioning to yours. You may have heard from them, or maybe not, about new experiences with professors, classes, extra-curriculars, the city of Fredericksburg, or even laundry in the residence halls. And this may lead you to think about their interaction in our community.
