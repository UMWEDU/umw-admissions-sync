Your baby’s all grown up and ready to go on to great things. How did this happen?

No doubt about it, the transition from high school to college is emotionally charged, for everyone involved, including parents. The University of Mary Washington is here to help.

Lost in a sea of paperwork? Confused by campus visits, tours, and open houses? Confounded by financial aid forms?

The answers to the following FAQs might help ease your anxiety, but don’t hesitate to contact the UMW Office of Admissions at 800-468-5614 or <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a> with any questions or concerns.
<h2>Where is UMW?</h2>
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/University+of+Mary+Washington/">UMW</a> is located in historic Fredericksburg, Virginia, directly between two important cities. We’re an hour south of Washington, D.C., and an hour north of Richmond, the capital of the Commonwealth of Virginia. This incredible location lends itself to a rich array of internship, research, and volunteer opportunities for intellectual and professional growth. Who knows, your student might even land a job before graduation.

Surrounded by Fredericksburg’s Civil War battlefields, museums, and quaint shops and eateries, and with Central Park, the East Coast’s largest shopping center, teeming with hundreds of the hottest retailers and restaurants just a few miles away, UMW offers a rich dichotomy of <a href="http://students.umw.edu/studentactivities/things-to-do-at-umw/">exploration</a>.
<h2>How do we get started?</h2>
<a href="/admissions/visit/">Seeing is believing</a>, and we hope one of the first steps in your family’s quest to find the perfect college, will be a visit to our beautiful wooded campus in historic Fredericksburg. We’re betting you and your student will fall in love with everything from our stately Georgian architecture and quaint brick-lined walkways to our enticing array of dining and entertainment options on and around campus.
<h2>How will we afford this?</h2>
The University of Mary Washington is consistently ranked as one of the country’s top “<a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/studentaccounts/tuition-and-fees/">best value</a>” schools by such publications as <em>Fiske Guide to Colleges</em>, <em>The Princeton Review</em>, and <em>Kiplinger’s Personal Finance</em>.

Each year UMW administers more than $32 million in financial assistance, including <a href="https://fafsa.ed.gov/">educational loans</a> totaling $19 million. The <a href="http://www.umw.edu/financialaid/">Office of Financial Aid</a> is here to help students afford the education they deserve through an array of grants, scholarships, loans, and student employment opportunities.
<h2>Will my student be safe and well at UMW?</h2>
From their very first day on campus, all UMW students pledge to follow the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/honor-system/">Honor Code</a>, agreeing to conduct themselves with integrity and commit to high ethical standards.

For your student’s safety, emergency blue-light response systems are strewn throughout campus. We provide a constant <a href="http://www.umw.edu/police/">university police presence</a>, safety escort services, and <a href="http://www.umw.edu/alerts/">UMW Alerts</a> – a network of text, email, and online messages notifying students and parents of potential emergencies or concerns both on campus and off.

<a href="http://students.umw.edu/healthcenter/">UMW’s Health Center</a> includes a full-time physician, nurse practitioners, RNs, and an <a href="http://students.umw.edu/healthcenter/after-hours-advice/">after-hours</a> HealthLink phone service; it offers programs and services in education, prevention, and self-care. The campus is located less than five minutes from the region’s largest healthcare facility.

Students can tap into the offerings of <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/disability/">Disability Resources</a>; the <a href="http://students.umw.edu/counseling/">Talley Center for Counseling Services</a>, with individual therapy, group counseling, crisis intervention, consultation, and referrals; and more.
<h2>Will my student be comfortable and happy at UMW?</h2>
<a href="http://adminfinance.umw.edu/eagleone/">UMW students</a> have a wide array of living arrangements from which to choose, from same-sex and co-ed dorms to living-and-learning communities and apartments for upper-classmen. All <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/residencehalls/">residence halls</a> have laundry rooms, vending machines, kitchens, TV rooms, study lounges, and recreational space.

A tantalizing menu of <a href="http://students.umw.edu/residencelife/mealplan/">meal plans</a> and <a href="https://umw.sodexomyway.com/dining-choices/index.html">dining options</a>– from hearty dishes, like the meatloaf and mashed potatoes you serve at home, to fast-food fare, including pizza, pasta, burgers, and sandwiches – awaits. The University Center houses all-you-care-to-eat buffets at nine specialty serving areas, and an in-house bakery with fresh breads and pastries. Global, vegan, vegetarian, and allergen-free options are also available, along with on-campus retailers, like Qdoba Mexican Grill, Jamba Juice, Blackstone Coffee, Naturally Woodstock, and Vocelli Pizza.

And from Move-In Day and Honor Convocation all the way to Commencement, your student’s four-year UMW experience will be packed with <a href="/students/">activities</a>. We offer more than 120 <a href="http://students.umw.edu/studentactivities/list/">clubs and organizations</a>, competitive <a href="http://umweagles.com/landing/index">NCAA sports</a> teams, and a calendar full of annual events, from Relay for Life to the Multicultural Fair.
