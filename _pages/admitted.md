We hope to be able to offer in person admitted student events in the spring. Please check back in January for additional information. In the meantime, we do offer virtual sessions.

These topical perspectives are led by faculty and staff from academic majors, programs, student affairs, and student service or support areas across campus who are ready to share their knowledge and love of UMW with you. Check out the <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2020/05/CALENDAR-Webinars-May-2020.pdf">calendar</a>Â and then <a href="https://admissions.umw.edu/portal/webinars">register</a> for all that interest you. We've also included some sample class lectures!

If you have questions regarding admissions events/tours, contact the Admissions office at <a href="mailto:admit@umw.edu">admit@umw.edu</a>.
