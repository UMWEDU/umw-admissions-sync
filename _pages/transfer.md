<h2>Transferring to UMW is easy!</h2>
Great ratings in some of higher education’s most prestigious publications, an impressive location between state and national capitals, a renowned reputation for service-oriented learning ...

The only thing missing from the University of Mary Washington is you! <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/apply">Apply today!</a>

If you’ve earned a high-school diploma, GED, or equivalent, you can apply to transfer to UMW from any two- or four-year school, no matter where you are in your college career.

With an associate’s degree and a 3.25 minimum cumulative GPA, you may qualify for UMW’s <a href="/admissions/transfer/guaranteed-admission-agreement/">Guaranteed Admissions Agreement </a>with the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) and Richard Bland College. In fall 2015, over 300 students – from the Virginia Community College System and other schools, both inside and outside Virginia – did just that, transferring into UMW’s bachelor’s of arts and sciences programs.

Students who transfer to Mary Washington also can apply to our:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://cas.umw.edu/bls/">Bachelor of Liberal Studies</a> (BLS) program, providing a flexible curriculum designed to meet the needs of adult learners.</li>
	<li><a href="http://cas.umw.edu/bsn-program/">Bachelor of Science in Nursing</a> (BSN) completion program for nurses who want to complete a baccalaureate degree in nursing.</li>
	<li><a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/registration-instructions-for-nondegree-students-and-auditors/">Non-degree enrollment program</a>, which allows non-degree-seeking students to take classes when space is available.</li>
</ul>
Come, join us...where great minds get to work!
