The only thing missing from the University of Mary Washington is you! Choose your transfer program. <a href="http://www.umw.edu/admissions/apply/">Apply online</a>!

If you’ve earned a high-school diploma, GED, or equivalent, you can apply to transfer to UMW from any two- or four-year school, no matter where you are in your college career.

With an associate’s degree and a 3.25 minimum cumulative GPA, you may qualify for UMW’s <a href="/admissions/transfer/guaranteed-admission-agreement/">Guaranteed Admissions Agreement </a>with the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) and Richard Bland College. In fall 2017, over 350 students – from the Virginia Community College System and other schools, both inside and outside Virginia – did just that, transferring into UMW’s bachelor’s of arts and sciences programs.

Students can also choose a <a href="http://academics.umw.edu/registrar/registration-instructions-for-nondegree-students-and-auditors/">non-degree enrollment program</a>, which allows non-degree-seeking students to take classes when space is available.

Come, join us...where great minds get to work!
