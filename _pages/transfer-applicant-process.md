No matter how, where, or why you began your college career, the University of Mary Washington is a great place to finish. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help get you started.
<ol>
<ol>
	<li>Take note of deadlines. Preferred application filing dates are:
<ul>
	<li>Spring semester: Oct. 15</li>
	<li>Summer semester: March 1</li>
	<li>Fall semester: We are still accepting applications for fall 2016</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Decide if you can take advantage of the Guaranteed Admissions Agreement UMW has with the Virginia Community College System and Richard Bland College. If you’ve earned an associate’s degree, with a 3.25 minimum cumulative GPA, you may qualify. If you choose this option, please include the GAA Student Letter of Intent form with your application.</li>
	<li>Gather materials needed for admission of most transfer students:
<ul>
	<li>Final high school transcript</li>
	<li>SAT/ACT scores (for those with fewer than 30 college credits)</li>
	<li>Official college transcript (one from each school attended)</li>
	<li>Letters of recommendation</li>
	<li>Common Application</li>
	<li>UMW member screen</li>
	<li>Essay</li>
	<li>Application fee (credit card or e-check required) or approved waiver</li>
</ul>
</li>
	<li>Decide if you fall into a special category that requires more documentation or holds a greater array of options.
<ul>
	<li>International transfer students, for example, should note that the Department of Homeland Security uses the web-based Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) to protect national security while supporting the legal entry of nonimmigrant students in the U.S. on F, M, and J visas for education and cultural exchange. These students must submit the SEVIS Transfer I-20 Request Form. If your immigration status is derived from your parent
or spouse, you’ll also need to include supporting documents of the primary visa<a name="2"></a> holder, a copy of the front and back of your current Form I-94, financial documentation such as an original bank statement, and a copy of your passport photo page.</li>
	<li>Those with professional experience who have gained knowledge in particular subject areas and are entering the BA/BS program may earn credit through the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), administered by the College Board, as long as the CLEP exams were taken before the student gained degree-seeking status at UMW. BLS students are eligible for CLEP credit any time before earning 30 credits in alternative credit testing and before earning 90 transfer credits toward the degree. Credit is granted for subject exam scores above the 50th percentile, except in the case of general exams, for which no credit is granted. Credits earned through CLEP can count toward the major, general education program, or elective credit requirements, but can’t fulfill across-the-curriculum requirements.</li>
	<li>Members of the armed forces – active duty military, reservists, veterans, and members of the Virginia National Guard – can receive academic credit for military education, training, and experience. Read the full policy statement or contact the Registrar.</li>
	<li>Adult students with at least 30 college credit hours, and who meet other criteria, might be interested in transferring into our Bachelor of Liberal Studies or BLS program, specifically designed to meet their needs.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Mail or forward all materials to UMW:</li>
