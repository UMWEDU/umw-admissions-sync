<strong>International Admission Checklist</strong>

These are the items required of international applicants for admission consideration.

<strong>1. The Application</strong>

You’ll need a completed <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common Application Form</a> and your essay/personal statement, plus your $50 application fee or approved waiver.

Remember to apply by the suggested filing date:
First Year applicants - Jan. 1 for priority admission or Feb. 1 for regular admission
Transfer applicants - Oct. 15 for spring and April 1 for fall

UMW accepts applications after these deadlines on a space-available basis and considering visa processing timelines.

<strong>2. Transcripts and/or Exam Scores</strong>

We know you’re smart, but we need the proof. Send transcripts and/or exam results – matriculation certificates, mark sheets, diplomas – with a certified copy of the English translation, for high school work you’ve completed. If you are applying as a transfer student, a transcript from each college or university you attended is also required.  Original documents are preferred; copies must be certified and attested by the U.S. embassy or notary public. Agencies offering translations include:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.wes.org">World Education Services Inc.</a></li>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ece.org/">Educational Credential Evaluators</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.aacrao.org/">American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>3. Testimonials</strong>

We want to hear about all the great parts of your personality, too. You’ll need at least one letter of recommendation from a counselor or teacher, using the <a href="https://recsupport.commonapp.org/link/portal/33011/33014/ArticleFolder/42/School-Report">Common Application Secondary School Report</a>.

<strong>4. English Language Proficiency</strong>

Proof of English language proficiency should be sent directly to UMW from the evaluating organization. These exam scores will get you in the running:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">Test of English as a Foreign Language</a> (TOEFL 88 IBT)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.els.edu/en">ELS Language Center</a>’s Intensive English Program (Level 112 completion)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.ielts.org/">International English Language Testing System</a> (6.5 on the academic exam)</li>
 	<li><a href="https://sat.collegeboard.org/home">College Board’s SAT</a> (Evidence Based Critical Reading, 550; Math 550; use UMW SAT testing code 5398)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://www.actstudent.org/">ACT</a> (composite score of 22 or higher; use UMW ACT testing code 4414)</li>
</ul>
If your first language is English, your native country names English an official language, you’re graduating from a secondary school in a native English-speaking country or from an International Baccalaureate secondary school, or you scored well on the SAT verbal portion, you may request an English language requirement waiver.

<strong>5. Financial Support</strong>

Non-U.S. citizens will need to provide a Financial Statement of Support, with information about available resources for paying for their U.S. education.
