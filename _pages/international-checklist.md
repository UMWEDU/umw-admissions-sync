And, you’re off!

Welcome to your international education at UMW … you’re going to love it!

Here’s the top five attractions our UMW Admissions staff look for with your application:

<strong>1. The Basics</strong>

You’ll need a completed <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">Common Application Form</a> and your fabulous essay, plus your $50 application fee or approved waiver. Remember to apply by the suggested filing date of Jan. 1 for priority admission or Feb. 1 for regular admission. UMW accepts applications after these deadlines on a rolling, space-available basis.

<strong>2. Test Scores</strong>

We know you’re smart, but we need the proof. Send transcripts and/or exam results – matriculation certificates, mark sheets, diplomas – with a certified copy of the English translation, for all secondary and tertiary work you’ve completed. Original documents are preferred; copies must be certified and attested by the U.S. embassy or notary public. Agencies offering translations include:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.wes.org">World Education Services Inc.</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.ece.org/">Educational Credential Evaluators</a></li>
	<li><a href="http://www.aacrao.org/">American Association of Collegiate Registrars and Admissions Officers</a></li>
</ul>
<strong>3. Testimonials</strong>

We want to hear about all the great parts of your personality, too. You’ll need at least one letter of recommendation from a counselor or teacher, using the <a href="https://recsupport.commonapp.org/link/portal/33011/33014/ArticleFolder/42/School-Report">Common Application Secondary School Report</a> or International School Supplement form.

<strong>4. Language Proficiency</strong>

Proof of English language proficiency should be sent directly to UMW from the evaluating organization. These exam scores will get you in the running:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://www.ets.org/toefl">Test of English as a Foreign Language</a> (composite score, 88 TOEFL IBT; paper-based score, 570)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.els.edu/en">ELS Language Center</a>’s Intensive English Program (Level 112 completion)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.ielts.org/">International English Language Testing System</a> (6.5 on the academic exam)</li>
	<li><a href="https://sat.collegeboard.org/home">College Board’s SAT</a> (critical reading, 550-660; math, 540-640; use UMW SAT testing code 5398)</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.actstudent.org/">ACT</a> (composite score of 24 or higher; use UMW ACT testing code 4414)</li>
</ul>
If your first language is English, your native country names English an official language, you’re graduating from a secondary school in a native English-speaking country or from an International Baccalaureate secondary school, or you scored well on the SAT verbal portion, you may request an English language requirement waiver.

<strong>5. Proof of Income</strong>

Non-U.S. citizens will need to provide a Financial Statement of Support, with information about available resources for paying for their U.S. education.
