The best way to learn about the University of Mary Washington is to attend an information session or another visit opportunity. Contact our office at <a href="mailto:graduate@umw.edu">graduate@umw.edu</a> or visit the corresponding event registration links below to register.
<h2>Individual Attention</h2>
