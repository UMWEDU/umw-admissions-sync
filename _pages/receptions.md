We will hope you and your parents can join us for a reception in the spring. You will be able to discover more about the University of Mary Washington and meet admissions staff, students, and alumni.
<p style="text-align: left">Please call the admissions office at 540/654-2000 or
800/468-5614 with any questions.</p>
Check back soon for spring dates!
