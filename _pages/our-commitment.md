<h2>Never Stop Learning!</h2>
Wherever it starts, whatever twists and turns it takes along the way, your continuing education is one of the most important journeys of your life. The University of Mary Washington is here to support that journey. We welcome applicants from Virginia’s two-year colleges and, through various agreements with other institutions of higher learning, help you streamline the admissions process and realize your professional goals.
<h3>Guaranteed Admissions Agreement (GAA)</h3>
Graduates of the Virginia Community College System (VCCS) and Richard Bland College who earn a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 may obtain <a href="/admissions/transfer/our-commitment/guaranteed-admission-agreement/">guaranteed admission to UMW</a>. Some UMW degree programs are more competitive than others and may require further acceptance by the specific program or department. Students who transfer to UMW under the GAA are considered to have met most general education requirements, with these exceptions:
<ul>
 	<li>competency in a second language</li>
 	<li>speaking- and writing-intensive courses</li>
 	<li>experiential learning</li>
</ul>
<h3>Germanna Co-Enrollment Agreement</h3>
<a href="http://ufc.umw.edu/files/2011/09/Co-enrollment-Agreement-details-12-14-11-1.pdf">Co-enrolled students</a> (pdf) may take up to five courses at UMW that will transfer back to their Germanna associate degree program. UMW will admit students who have earned an associate degree and met GPA requirements and accept up to 63 hours of their transfer credit. Students will need to submit a <a title="http://admissions.umw.edu/undergraduate/files/2011/09/Germanna-CoEnrollment-Form.pdf" href="/admissions/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2015/08/Germanna-CoEnrollment-Form.pdf">Letter of Intent</a>.
<h3>Germanna Direct Transfer Agreements</h3>
Eligible Germanna students can <a href="http://cas.umw.edu/bls/">transfer to UMW’s bachelor of liberal studies (BLS) degree program</a>, designed for adults whose life and/or experiences may require a non-traditional approach to completing their degree. The program is intended for students who, for example, have graduated from high school six or more years ago; are financially self-supporting; or have significant life or professional experiences that translate into academic knowledge that can contribute to the completion of the Bachelor’s degree.
