<a href="http://students.umw.edu/fredericksburg-orientation/">New Student Orientation</a> is required for all new students – freshmen <img class="alignright wp-image-39661 size-full" src="http://admissions.umw.edu/youarein/files/2011/12/UMW-Orientation.jpg" alt="Carnival on Ball Circle" width="300" height="201" />and transfers, residential and commuting – but you’d want to go even if it were optional. You’ll take care of all the usual details like checking out your new P.O. box, buying a loft or refrigerator (if you need one), and finding out how to connect to the UMW network, but that’s only the beginning.

Previous orientations have given students the chance to tube down the Rappahannock River, eat a giant ice cream sundae with UMW President Troy Paino, and create their own illumination at a glow dance. Finally, your orientation will get serious with the Honor Convocation, where all new students make a pledge to not lie, cheat, or steal while they are students at UMW. If you have questions about New Student Orientation, please contact the Office of Student Affairs at 540/654-1062.
